  "Drug Name: 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION, 500ML, DRE BIOLAB, TOTALCARE. Description: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic. It is a parenteral solution containing sodium chloride in water for injection intended for intravenous administration. For 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, each 100 mL contains 900 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Electrolytes per 1,000 mL: sodium 154 mEq; chloride 154 mEq. The osmolarity is 308 mOsmol/L (calc.). The pH in the 100 mL and smaller containers is 6.0; for the 250 mL and larger containers, the pH is 5.6. The pH range is 4.5 to 7.0 for all containers. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. The solution is a parenteral fluid and electrolyte replenisher.Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H2O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers. The bag has a needle-free injection port and can accept standard luer lock syringes to add medication. The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container's chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. When administered intravenously, the solution provides a source of water and electrolytes. Solutions which provide combinations of hypotonic or isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements. Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss. Hypotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suited for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when only small quantities of salt are desired. A hypertonic concentration of sodium chloride may be used to repair severe salt depletion syndrome. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl-) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium. Intravenous solutions containing sodium chloride are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the clinical condition of the patient. None known. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention. The intravenous administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutive states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. In patients with diminished renal function, administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may result in sodium retention. General Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers. Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Caution must be exercised in the administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. It is also not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is administered to a nursing mother. Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the effects of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP on labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised when administrating this drug during labor and delivery. The use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice. Plasma electrolyte concentrations should be closely monitored in the pediatric population as this population may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes. Clinical studies of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary. In the event of overhydration or solute overload, re-evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (see PRECAUTIONS).

  "Drug Name: .ALPHA.1-PROTEINASE INHIBITOR HUMAN. Description: GLASSIA is a sterile, ready to use, liquid preparation of purified human Alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (Alpha1-PI), also known as alpha1-antitrypsin (AAT). The solution contains 2% active Alpha1-PI in a phosphate-buffered saline solution. The specific activity of GLASSIA is ≥ 0.7 mg functional Alpha1-PI per mg of total protein. Not less than 90% of the Alpha1-PI in GLASSIA is of the monomeric form as measured by size-exclusion chromatography. GLASSIA is prepared from human plasma obtained from US-licensed plasma collection centers by a modified version of the cold ethanol fractionation process and the Alpha1-PI is then purified using chromatographic methods. Individual plasma units used for production of GLASSIA are tested using FDA- licensed serological assays for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for antibodies to hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodeficiency virus types 1 and 2 (HIV-1/2), as well as by FDA-licensed Nucleic Acid Testing (NAT) for HCV and HIV-1. Each plasma unit must be non-reactive (negative) in all tests. Plasma is also tested by in-process NAT procedures for parvovirus B19 and the limit for B19 DNA in the manufacturing pool is set not to exceed 104IU per mL. To reduce the risk of viral transmission, the manufacturing process for GLASSIA includes two steps specifically designed to remove or inactivate viruses. The first of these is nanofiltration (NF) through a 15 nm filter which can remove both enveloped and non–enveloped viral agents and the second is solvent/detergent (S/D) treatment with a mixture of tri-(n-butyl) phosphate (TNBP) and Polysorbate 80 (Tween 80) which inactivates enveloped viral agents such as HIV, HBV and HCV. The effectiveness of the S/D treatment and nanofiltration procedures for reducing virus content has been assessed using a series of viruses with a range of physico-chemical characteristics. The results of the viral challenge studies are summarized inTable 4.

  "Drug Name: 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION, 500ML, BLUE PHARMACEUTICALS, TOTALCARE. Description: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic. It is a parenteral solution containing sodium chloride in water for injection intended for intravenous administration. For 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, each 100 mL contains 900 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Electrolytes per 1,000 mL: sodium 154 mEq; chloride 154 mEq. The osmolarity is 308 mOsmol/L (calc.). The pH in the 100 mL and smaller containers is 6.0; for the 250 mL and larger containers, the pH is 5.6. The pH range is 4.5 to 7.0 for all containers. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. The solution is a parenteral fluid and electrolyte replenisher.Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H2O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers. The bag has a needle-free injection port and can accept standard luer lock syringes to add medication. The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container's chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. When administered intravenously, the solution provides a source of water and electrolytes. Solutions which provide combinations of hypotonic or isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements. Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss. Hypotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suited for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when only small quantities of salt are desired. A hypertonic concentration of sodium chloride may be used to repair severe salt depletion syndrome. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl-) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium. Intravenous solutions containing sodium chloride are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the clinical condition of the patient. None known. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention. The intravenous administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutive states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. In patients with diminished renal function, administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may result in sodium retention. General Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers. Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Caution must be exercised in the administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. It is also not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is administered to a nursing mother. Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the effects of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP on labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised when administrating this drug during labor and delivery. The use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice. Plasma electrolyte concentrations should be closely monitored in the pediatric population as this population may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes. Clinical studies of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary. In the event of overhydration or solute overload, re-evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (see PRECAUTIONS). Check flexible container solution composition, lot number, and expiry date.Do not remove solution container from its overwrap until immediately before use. Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique. To Open 1. Turn solution container over so that the text is face down. Using the pre-cut corner tabs, peel open the overwrap and remove solution container. 2. Check the solution container for leaks by squeezing firmly. If leaks are found, or if the seal is not intact, discard the solution.3. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present. To Add Medication The Additive port of the container accepts standard luer lock syringes. Do not use a needle for additions.1. Identify LIGHT BLUE Additive Port with arrow pointing toward solution container.2. Immediately before injecting additives, break off LIGHT BLUE Additive Port Cap with the arrow pointing toward solution container. 3. Hold base of LIGHT BLUE Additive Port.4.

  "Drug Name: 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE SOLUTION. Description: NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCTTURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE Solution QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITIONActive substance:Each 100 ml of solution contains 0.9 g sodium chloride.Excipients: WaterOsmolarity of solution is 308 mOsmol/l.Ionic concentrations of solution:- sodium: 154 mEq/l- chloride: 154 mEq/l PHARMACEUTICAL FORMSterile solution for intravenous infusion 4.2. Posology and method of administrationPosology/frequency and duration of administrationThe dosage is to be individualized by the physician depending on age, weight, clinical condition and in particular the patient’s hydration state. Serum electrolyte concentrations must be monitored during treatment. In general, 500 to 3000 ml per 24 hours for adults, adolescents and elderly and 20 to 100 ml/kg per 24 hours for infants and children is recommended for treatment of isotonic extracellular dehydration and sodium depletion unless otherwise prescribed by the doctor.The dosage when used as a diluent should be determined by the nature and the dose regimen of the diluted drug. In general 50 to 250 ml of fluid is sufficient. The frequency of administration and dosage is adjusted by the physician according to the clinical condition of the patient.When TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is used as a diluent, the infusion rate will be adjusted according to the nature and the dose regimen of the diluted drug. Method of administration:The administration is to be made by intravenous route in a peripheral or central vein using sterile, apyrogenic sets.See also section 6.6 for details on the administration. Additional information on special populations:Renal/Hepatic failure:No dosage recommendations are made for this patient group, as there is no specific study for this population. Pediatric population:As in adults, dosage and infusion rate are directed by a physician depending on weight, clinical and biological condition of the patient and the concomitant treatment.In general 20 to 100 ml/kg per 24 h is recommended in this population. Geriatric population:As in adults, dosage and infusion rate are directed by a physician depending on weight, clinical and biological condition of the patient and the concomitant treatment. Therapeutic indicationsTURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is indicated for:- Treatment of isotonic extracellular dehydration- Treatment of sodium depletion- As diluent of compatible drugs for parenteral administration. The solution is contraindicated in patient presenting hypernatremia or hyperchloremia.It is also contraindicated where the administration of sodium or chloride could be clinically detrimental. Special warnings and precautions for useThe administration of intravenous solutions can cause fluid and/or solute overload resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilution is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration. The risk of congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentration.The solution contains 154 mmol/l sodium (Na+) and 154 mmol/l chloride (Cl-); the osmolarity is about 308 mOsm/l and the pH is 5.5 (4.5-7.0).Careful clinical monitoring is required at the beginning of any intravenous infusion.Administrations should be periodically and carefully monitored. Clinical and biological parameters, in particular serum electrolyte concentrations should be monitored.In preterm or term neonates, sodium retention can be seen because renal function is not yet fully developed. Repeated infusions of sodium chloride in neonates should therefore only be given after determination of the serum sodium levels.Sodium-containing solutions should be used with caution in cases of hypertension, heart failure, peripheral or pulmonary edema, impaired renal function, preeclampsia, aldosteronism or other conditions and treatments with sodium accumulation (e.g. corticosteroid therapy).Pseudohyponatremia is a condition in which plasma sodium is falsely low as measured by conventional methods in spite of the fact that it is not actually low. This may occur when large molecules are at a high concentration at an abnormally high level and, consequently, when the plasma water ratio falls abnormally. It has been reported that associated hyperlipemia and hyperproteinemia can also be seen in patients with diabetes mellitus. Real values can be obtained by evaluating the concentration based on plasma/water ratio. Excessive administration of potassium-free solutions may result in significant hypokalemia. Serum potassium levels should be maintained and potassium supplemented as required.To minimize the risk of possible incompatibilities arising from mixing any of these solutions with other additives that may be prescribed, the final mixture should be inspected for cloudiness or precipitation immediately after mixing, prior to administration and periodically during administration.If administration is controlled by a pumping device, care must be taken to discontinue pumping action before the container runs dry or air embolism may result. This solution is intended for intravenous administration using sterile equipment. It is recommended that intravenous administration apparatus be replaced at least once every 24 hours.Use only if solution is clear and container and seals are intact.Laboratory tests:Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Significant deviations from normal concentrations may require normalization of these values with alternative solutions.Warnings and precautions for pediatric use:In neonates or in very small infants even small volumes of fluid may affect fluid and electrolyte balance. Care must be exercised in treatment of neonates, especially pre-term neonates, whose renal function may be immature and whose ability to excrete fluid and solute loads may be limited. Fluid intake, urine output, and serum electrolytes should be monitored closely.Warnings and precautions for use in elderly:In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious. Starting at the low end of the dosing range is recommended in elderly considering the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or other drug therapy. Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interactionSome of the drugs and solutions added to the solution may be incompatible. As in all parenteral solutions, compatibility with additional medication should be evaluated by the physician.If other substances are to be added to the solution, aseptic technique should be used and shaken until mixed. It should be ensured that there is no discoloration, insoluble particles and crystallization after the drugs are added into TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE.Caution should be exercised because of the risk of sodium and water retention when used with corticosteroids and carbenoxolone due to its sodium content. Special populations:No interaction studies have been performed with TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE on special population.Pediatric population:No interaction studies have been performed with TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE in the pediatric population. General recommendationPregnancy category: CWomen with childbearing potential/ContraceptionNo effects of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE on women of childbearing potential or interaction with drugs used for birth control (contraception) have been reported.PregnancyThere are no adequate data from the use of isotonic sodium chloride solutions in pregnant women.Studies on animals are insufficient in terms of effects on pregnancy / and - or / embryonal / fetal development / and - or / birth / and - or postnatal development. (See section 5.3). Potential risk for human is unknown.TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should not be used during pregnancy unless it is necessary for life-threatening conditions.Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with sodium chloride containing solutions.It is also not known whether TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity.TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.Delivery:The effects of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE on the duration of labor or delivery, on the possibility that forceps delivery or other intervention or resuscitation of thenewborn will be necessary, and on the later growth, development, and functional maturation of the child are unknown.Administration of sodium and dextrose containing solutions during labor and delivery have been reported in the literature. Caution should be exercised, and the fluid balance, glucose and electrolyte concentrations, and acid-base balance, of both mother and fetus should be evaluated periodically or whenever warranted by the condition of the patient or fetus. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is administered to a nursing woman. There are no data on the effects of sodium chloride solutions on fertility. Undesirable effects are not expected in normal conditions of treatment.Undesirable effects may result from an excess or deficit of one or more of the ions present in the solution; therefore, frequent monitoring of electrolyte levels is essential. The physician should also be alert to the possibility of adverse reactions to drug additives. Prescribing information for drug additives to be administered in this manner should be consulted. Injudicious intravenous sodium chloride therapy (e.g. post-operatively and in patients with impaired cardiac or renal function) may cause hypernatraemia. Osmotically induced water shifts decrease intracellular volume, resulting in dehydration of internal organs, especially the brain, which may lead to thrombosis and haemorrhage.If administered sub-cutaneously, any addition to the isotonic solution could render it hypertonic and cause pain at the site of injection.Administration of large doses may give rise to sodium accumulation, oedema, and hyperchloraemic acidosis. If an adverse reaction does occur during administration, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures.The displayed frequency categories use the following convention: Very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated form the available data). The following adverse reactions are those that may result in an excess of sodium or chloride due to overdose, or may be due to administration technique. The frequency of these side effects is not known (it can be seen in as few patients as cannot be identified with the available data).Blood and lymphatic system disordersNot known: Thrombosis; hemorrhageMetabolism and nutrition disordersNot known: Sodium accumulation; Water retention and edema; Exacerbation of congestive heart failure (due to hypernatremia); Hyperchloremic acidosis.Nervous system disordersNot known: Headache, dizziness, restlessness, irritation, convulsions, coma and death (dehydration of the brain associated with hypernatremia). Cardiac disordersNot known: Tachycardia (associated with hypernatremia).Vascular disordersNot known: Hypertension (associated with hypernatremia).Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disordersNot known: Pulmonary edema, respiratory depression and respiratory arrest (associated with hypernatremia).Gastrointestinal disordersNot known: Nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, feeling of thirst, decreased salivation (associated with hypernatremia).Skin and subcutaneous tissue disordersNot known: Decreased perspiration (associated with hypernatremia). Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disordersNot known: Muscle twitching and rigidity (associated with hypernatremia).Renal and urinary disordersNot known: Renal failure (associated with hypernatremia)General disorders and administration site conditionsNot known: Fever; Fatigue (due to hypernatremia); Pain at the injection site (due to subcutaneous administration of hypertonic solution with additions).Surgical and medical proceduresNot known: Febrile reactions; infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection; extravasation and hypervolemia (adverse effects that can be seen due to the technique of administration). Adverse reactions of sodium excess in the body include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal cramps, thirst, reduced salivation, lacrimation and sweating, fever, tachycardia, hypertension, renal failure, peripheral and pulmonary oedema, respiratory arrest, headache, dizziness, restlessness, irritability, fatigue, muscular twitching and rigidity, convulsions, coma, and death.Excess chloride accumulation in the body may cause a loss of bicarbonate with an acidifying effect on body fluids.In the event of a fluid or solute overload during parenteral therapy, reevaluate the patient's condition and institute appropriate corrective treatment.Diuretics may be used in the treatment of oedema associated with isotonic expansion and appropriate replacement therapy which will not cause fluid electrolyte imbalance should be applied.Treatment of hypervolemic hypernatremia requires removal of more sodium than water from the body and diuretic-induced sodium and water loss can only be met by water. The main purpose of the treatment is to normalize the volume and composition of body fluids.When overdose is related to medicinal products added to the solution infused, the signs and symptoms of over infusion will be related to the nature of the additive being used. In the event of accidental over infusion, treatment should be discontinued and the patient should be observed for the appropriate signs and symptoms related to the drug administered. The relevant symptomatic and supportive measures should be provided as necessary. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Intravenous solutions/Solutions affecting electrolyte balanceATC code: B05XA03TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE is an isotonic solution, with an approximate osmolarity of 308 mOsm/l.The pharmacodynamic properties of the solution are those of the sodium and chloride ions in maintaining the fluid and electrolyte balance.Ions, such as sodium, circulate through the cell membrane, using various mechanisms of transport, among which is the sodium pump (Na-K-ATPase) Sodium plays an important role in neurotransmission, cardiac electrophysiology and in renal metabolism.Chloride is mainly an extracellular anion. Intracellular chloride is in high concentration in red blood cells and gastric mucosa. Reabsorption of chloride follows reabsorption of sodium.The pharmacodynamic properties of the added drugs are the same as the pharmacodynamic properties of the added drug. General propertiesPharmacokinetic properties of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE are those of its components (sodium and chloride).Absorption:Active substances in drugs administered intravenously reach their maximum plasma concentrations immediately after administration.Distribution:Sodium distribution varies according to tissues: it is fast in muscles, liver, kidney, cartilage and skin; it is slow in erythrocytes and neurons; it is very slow in the bone.Chloride is mainly distributed in extracellular fluids.Biotransformation:The half-life after radioactively labeled sodium (24Na) injection is 11-13 days for 99% of injected sodium and one year for the remaining 1%. Chloride closely monitors sodium metabolism and changes in the acid-base balance of the body are reflected by changes in chloride concentration.Elimination:Sodium is excreted primarily by the renal route, but at the same time the vast majority is reabsorbed by the renal route. A small amount of sodium is excreted with feces and sweat.Since chloride metabolically monitors sodium, it is mainly excreted by the renal route but also in lesser amounts in feces and sweat.Linearity/Non-linearity:Electrolytes in the TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE composition show a linear pharmacokinetic behavior when administered to the body at therapeutic doses to complete their deficiency. Because the components of the solution are physiological components of human and animal plasma and are not expected to show toxic effects in clinical practice, studies with TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE have not been performed to evaluate the effects of carcinogenic, mutagenic potential and fertility.The safety of medications added into the solution must be considered separately. IncompatibilitiesIncompatibility of the medicinal product to be added with the solution must be assessed before addition. In the absence of compatibility data, this solution must not be mixed with other medicinal products.It is the responsibility of the physician to judge the incompatibility of an additive medication with the solution by checking for eventual color change and/or eventual precipitate, insoluble complexes or crystals apparition. The prescribing information of the drug to be added to TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE must be consulted to decide whether the additive is compatible. Before adding a drug, its solubility and stability at the pH of TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should be verified.TURKFLEKS 0.9% ISOTONIC SODIUM CHLORIDE should be immediately used following the addition of a compatible drug.Those additives known to be incompatible should not be used.6.3. Shelf life36 months.Shelf life during use for dilution:From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8°C, unless reconstitution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic conditions.6.4. Special precautions for storageThere are no special conditions for storage. It must be kept at room temperature under 30 °C.6.5. Nature and contents of container50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 1000 and 3000 ml PP (polypropylene) bagsProduct has in two forms: with and without set. Directions for useSolution should be inspected visually before use.The administration is by intravenous route with sterile sets.Only products that are clear, particle-free and intact in packaging integrity should be used.The administration should be started as soon as possible after the application set is attached to the product.In order to prevent an air embolisation that may occur due to the residual air in the bag, no serial connection should be made with other infusion fluids. Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration.The solution should be applied using the aseptic technique through the sterile application set. In order to prevent air from entering the system, liquid must be passed through the application set before use.Additional medication may be added before and during infusion with the aid of injection a needle in aseptic conditions. The final product’s isotonicity should be determined before parenteral administration.The added drug must be completely mixed with the solution before application to the patient. Solutions containing additives should be used immediately and not stored.Adding other medication or using an incorrect administration technique might cause the appearance of fever reactions due to the possible introduction of pyrogens. In case of adverse reaction, infusion must be stopped immediately.For single use.Do not store partially used solutions.Do not reconnect partially used bags. To open:1. Check the integrity of the outer packaging and check for leaks; do not use if the packaging is damaged.2. Tear off the protective outer packaging.3.

  "Drug Name: 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION, 1000ML, BLUE PHARMA, TOTALCARE. Description: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic. It is a parenteral solution containing sodium chloride in water for injection intended for intravenous administration. For 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, each 100 mL contains 900 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Electrolytes per 1,000 mL: sodium 154 mEq; chloride 154 mEq. The osmolarity is 308 mOsmol/L (calc.). The pH in the 100 mL and smaller containers is 6.0; for the 250 mL and larger containers, the pH is 5.6. The pH range is 4.5 to 7.0 for all containers. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. The solution is a parenteral fluid and electrolyte replenisher.Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H2O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers. The bag has a needle-free injection port and can accept standard luer lock syringes to add medication. The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container's chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. When administered intravenously, the solution provides a source of water and electrolytes. Solutions which provide combinations of hypotonic or isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements. Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss. Hypotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suited for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when only small quantities of salt are desired. A hypertonic concentration of sodium chloride may be used to repair severe salt depletion syndrome. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl-) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium. Intravenous solutions containing sodium chloride are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the clinical condition of the patient. None known. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention. The intravenous administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutive states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. In patients with diminished renal function, administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may result in sodium retention. General Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers. Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Caution must be exercised in the administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. It is also not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is administered to a nursing mother. Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the effects of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP on labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised when administrating this drug during labor and delivery. The use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice. Plasma electrolyte concentrations should be closely monitored in the pediatric population as this population may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes. Clinical studies of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary. In the event of overhydration or solute overload, re-evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (see PRECAUTIONS). Check flexible container solution composition, lot number, and expiry date.Do not remove solution container from its overwrap until immediately before use. Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique. To Open 1. Turn solution container over so that the text is face down. Using the pre-cut corner tabs, peel open the overwrap and remove solution container. 2. Check the solution container for leaks by squeezing firmly. If leaks are found, or if the seal is not intact, discard the solution.3. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present. To Add Medication The Additive port of the container accepts standard luer lock syringes. Do not use a needle for additions.1.

Description: 0642-0075-30 Prenatal Supplement with DHA Rx Select-OB+DHA®is indicated to provide vitamin, mineral, and omega-3 fatty acid supplementation prior to conception, throughout pregnancy, and during the postnatal period for the lactating and non-lactating mother.* Select-OB+DHA®does not contain fish, fish oils, fish proteins or fish byproducts. Select-OB+DHA®is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components or color additives. Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitaminB12). Select-OB+DHA®should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to soy. Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased rick of heart disease can occur. Prolonged use of iron slats may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children. High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.

Iron is an essential component in the formation of hemoglobin. Adequate amounts of iron are necessary for effective erythropoiesis. Iron also serves as a cofactor of several essential enzymes, including cytochromes that are involved in electron transport. Folic acid is required for nucleoprotein synthesis and the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis. Folic acid is converted in the liver and plasma to its metabolically active form, tetrahydrofolic acid, by dihydrofolate reductase. Vitamin B12is required for the maintenance of normal erythropoiesis, nucleoprotein and myelin synthesis, cell reproduction and normal growth. Intrinsic factor, a glycoprotein secreted by the gastric mucosa, is required for active absorption of vitamin B12from the gastrointestinal tract. ACTIVE FE™ is an oral prescription multi-vitamin/multi-mineral dietary supplement for the use in improving the nutritional status of patients with iron deficiency.1 ACTIVE FE™ is contraindicated in patients with a known hypersensitivity to any of the components of this product. Hemolytic anemia, hemochromatosis and hemosiderosis are contraindications to iron therapy. Do not exceed recommended dose. The type of anemia and the underlying cause or causes should be determined before starting therapy with ACTIVE FE™. Since the anemia may be a result of a systemic disturbance, such as recurrent blood loss, the underlying cause or causes should be corrected, if possible. Folic acid in doses above 0.1 mg daily may obscure pernicious anemia in that hematologic remission can occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. Pernicious anemia should be excluded before using this product since folic acid may mask the symptoms of pernicious anemia. Safety and effectiveness in pediatric patients have not been established. Clinical studies on this product have not been performed in subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether elderly subjects respond differently from younger subjects. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious and start at the lower end of the dosing range. Do not exceed recommended dose.

Adverse reactions with iron therapy may include GI irritations, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, dark stools and abdominal pain. Adverse reactions with iron therapy are usually transient. Allergic sensitization has been reported following both oral and parenteral administration of folic acid. Carbonyl iron based products may decrease the absorption of medicines. Talk to your doctor and pharmacist before taking carbonyl products if you take any prescription or over-the-counter medicines. The clinical course of acute iron overdosage can be variable. Initial symptoms may include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, tarry stools melena, hematemesis, hypotension, tachycardia, metabolic acidosis, hyperglycemia, dehydration, drowsiness, pallor, cyanosis, lassitude, seizures, shock and coma.

Select-OB+DHA®is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components or color additives. Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitaminB12).

Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased rick of heart disease can occur. Prolonged use of iron slats may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12 deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children. High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. Zinc can inhibit the absorption of certain antibiotics; take at least 2 hours apart to minimize interactions. Consult appropriate references for additional specific vitamin-drug interactions.

SELECT-OB®is contraindicated in patients with hypersensitivity to any of its components or color additives. Folic acid is contraindicated in patients with untreated and uncomplicated pernicious anemia, and in those with anaphylactic sensitivity to folic acid. Iron therapy is contraindicated in patients with hemochromatosis and patients with iron storage disease or the potential for iron storage disease due to chronic hemolytic anemia (e.g., inherited anomalies of hemoglobin structure or synthesis and/or red cell enzyme deficiencies, etc.), pyridoxine responsive anemia, or cirrhosis of the liver. Cyanocobalamin is contraindicated in patients with sensitivity to cobalt or to cyanocobalamin (vitamin B12). SELECT-OB®should be used with caution in patients with known sensitivity or allergy to soy. Vitamin D supplementation should be used with caution in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones. High doses of vitamin D can lead to elevated levels of calcium that reside in the blood and soft tissues. Bone pain, high blood pressure, formation of kidney stones, renal failure, and increased risk of heart disease can occur. Prolonged use of iron salts may produce iron storage disease. Folic acid, especially in doses above 0.1 mg daily, may obscure pernicious anemia, in that hematologic remission may occur while neurological manifestations remain progressive. The use of folic acid doses above 1 mg daily may precipitate or exacerbate the neurological damage of vitamin B12deficiency. Consumption of more than 3 grams of omega-3 fatty acids per day from all sources may lead to excessive bleeding. Supplemental intake of omega-3 fatty acids such as DHA exceeding 2 grams per day is not recommended. Avoid overdosage. Keep out of the reach of children. High doses of folic acid may result in decreased serum levels of the anticonvulsant drugs. Vitamin D supplementation should not be given with large amounts of calcium in those with hypercalcemia or conditions that may lead to hypercalcemia such as hyperparathyroidism and those who form calcium-containing kidney stones.

  "Drug Name: .ALPHA.-TOCOPHEROL ACETATE, DL-, ASCORBIC ACID, CYANOCOBALAMIN, SODIUM FLUORIDE, FOLIC ACID, NIACIN, PYRIDOXINE, RIBOFLAVIN, THIAMINE, VITAMIN A, AND VITAMIN D. Description: It is well established that fluoridation of the water supply (1 ppm fluoride) during the period of tooth development leads to a significant decrease in the incidence of dental caries. Multivitamin with Fluoride0.25mg Chewable Tabletsprovide sodium fluoride and ten essential vitamins in a chewable tablet. Because the tablets are chewable, they provide atopicalas well assystemicsource of fluoride.Hydroxyapatiteis the principal crystal for all calcified tissue in the human body. The fluoride ion reacts with the hydroxyapatite in the tooth as it is formed to produce the more caries-resistant crystal,fluorapatite. The reaction may be expressed by the equation: Ca10(PO4)6(OH)2 + 2F- ------- Ca10(PO4)6F2 + 2OH- (Hydroxyapatite) (Fluorapatite) Three stages of fluoride deposition in tooth enamel can be distinguished: 1. Small amounts (reflecting the low levels of fluoride in tissue fluids) are incorporated into the enamel crystals while they are being formed. 2. After enamel has been laid down, fluoride deposition continues in the surface enamel. Diffusion of fluoride from the surface inward is apparently restricted. 3. After eruption, the surface enamel acquires fluoride from the water, food, supplementary fluoride and smaller amounts from saliva. Supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Supplementation of the diet with fluoride for caries prophylaxis. Multivitamin with Fluoride 0.25 mg Chewable Tabletsprovide 0.25 mg fluoride in tablet form for children 4-6years of age in areas where the drinking water contains 0.3 through 0.6 ppm of fluoride. Multivitamin with Fluoride0.25mg Chewable Tabletssupply significant amounts of Vitamins A, C, D, E, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, and folate to supplement the diet, and to help assure that nutritional deficiencies of these vitamins will not develop. Thus, in a single easy-to-use preparation, children obtain ten essential vitamins and the important mineral, fluoride. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that children up to age 16, in areas where drinking water contains less than optimal levels of fluoride, receive daily fluoride supplements. Children usingMultivitamin with Fluoride0.25mgChewable Tabletsregularly should receive semiannual dental examinations. The regular brushing of teeth and attention to good oral hygiene practices are also essential. Multivitamin with Fluoride Chewable Tablets is a prescription product for the clinical dietary management of the metabolic processes of caries prophylaxis and provides supplementation of the diet with ten essential vitamins. Keep out of the reach of children. In case of accidentaloverdose, seek professional assistance or contact aPoison Control Center immediately. CAUTION Do not eat or drink dairy products within one hour of fluoride administration. Should be chewed. This product, as all chewable tablets, is not recommended for children under age 4 due to risk of choking. The suggested dose ofMultivitamin with Fluoride0.25mgChewable Tabletsshould not be exceeded, since dental fluorosis may result from continued ingestion of large amounts of fluoride. Before prescribingMultivitamin with Fluoride0.25mgChewable Tablets: 1. Determine the fluoride content of the drinking water from all major sources. 2. Make sure the child is not receiving significant amounts of fluoride from other sources such as medications and swallowed toothpaste. 3. Periodically check to make sure that the child does not develop significant dental fluorosis. Allergic rash and other idiosyncrasies have been rarely reported. One tablet daily, to be dissolved in the mouth or chewed before swallowing. Do not give a chewable tablet to a child younger than 4 years old.

  "Drug Name: 0.9% SODIUM CHLORIDE INJECTION, 1000ML, DRE BIOLAB, TOTALCARE. Description: 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP solution is sterile and nonpyrogenic. It is a parenteral solution containing sodium chloride in water for injection intended for intravenous administration. For 0.9% Sodium Chloride Injection, USP, each 100 mL contains 900 mg sodium chloride in water for injection. Electrolytes per 1,000 mL: sodium 154 mEq; chloride 154 mEq. The osmolarity is 308 mOsmol/L (calc.). The pH in the 100 mL and smaller containers is 6.0; for the 250 mL and larger containers, the pH is 5.6. The pH range is 4.5 to 7.0 for all containers. The solution contains no bacteriostat, antimicrobial agent or added buffer and is intended only as a single-dose injection. When smaller doses are required the unused portion should be discarded. The solution is a parenteral fluid and electrolyte replenisher.Sodium Chloride, USP is chemically designated NaCl, a white crystalline powder freely soluble in water. Water for injection, USP is chemically designated H2O. The flexible container is fabricated from a specially formulated non-plasticized, film containing polypropylene and thermoplastic elastomers. The bag has a needle-free injection port and can accept standard luer lock syringes to add medication. The amount of water that can permeate from the container into the overwrap is insufficient to affect the solution significantly. Solutions in contact with the flexible container can leach out certain of the container's chemical components in very small amounts within the expiration period. The suitability of the container material has been confirmed by tests in animals according to USP biological tests for plastic containers. When administered intravenously, the solution provides a source of water and electrolytes. Solutions which provide combinations of hypotonic or isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral maintenance or replacement of water and electrolyte requirements. Isotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suitable for parenteral replacement of chloride losses that exceed or equal the sodium loss. Hypotonic concentrations of sodium chloride are suited for parenteral maintenance of water requirements when only small quantities of salt are desired. A hypertonic concentration of sodium chloride may be used to repair severe salt depletion syndrome. Sodium chloride in water dissociates to provide sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) ions. Sodium (Na+) is the principal cation of the extracellular fluid and plays a large part in the therapy of fluid and electrolyte disturbances. Chloride (Cl-) has an integral role in buffering action when oxygen and carbon dioxide exchange occurs in the red blood cells. The distribution and excretion of sodium (Na+) and chloride (Cl-) are largely under the control of the kidney which maintains a balance between intake and output. Water is an essential constituent of all body tissues and accounts for approximately 70% of total body weight. Average normal adult daily requirements range from two to three liters (1.0 to 1.5 liters each for insensible water loss by perspiration and urine production). Water balance is maintained by various regulatory mechanisms. Water distribution depends primarily on the concentration of electrolytes in the body compartments and sodium (Na+) plays a major role in maintaining physiologic equilibrium. Intravenous solutions containing sodium chloride are indicated for parenteral replenishment of fluid and sodium chloride as required by the clinical condition of the patient. None known. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be used with great care, if at all, in patients with congestive heart failure, severe renal insufficiency and in clinical states in which there exists edema with sodium retention. The intravenous administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fluid and/or solute overloading resulting in dilution of serum electrolyte concentrations, overhydration, congested states or pulmonary edema. The risk of dilutive states is inversely proportional to the electrolyte concentration of the injections. The risk of solute overload causing congested states with peripheral and pulmonary edema is directly proportional to the electrolyte concentrations of the injections. In patients with diminished renal function, administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP may result in sodium retention. General Do not use plastic containers in series connections. Such use could result in air embolism due to residual air being drawn from the primary container before administration of the fluid from the secondary container is completed. Pressurizing intravenous solutions contained in flexible plastic containers to increase flow rates can result in air embolism if the residual air in the container is not fully evacuated prior to administration. Use of a vented intravenous administration set with the vent in the open position could result in air embolism. Vented intravenous administration sets with the vent in the open position should not be used with flexible plastic containers. Laboratory Tests Clinical evaluation and periodic laboratory determinations are necessary to monitor changes in fluid balance, electrolyte concentrations and acid-base balance during prolonged parenteral therapy or whenever the condition of the patient warrants such evaluation. Caution must be exercised in the administration of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP to patients receiving corticosteroids or corticotropin. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility Teratogenic Effects Pregnancy Category C Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with Sodium Chloride Injection, USP. It is also not known whether Sodium Chloride Injection, USP can cause fetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman or can affect reproduction capacity. Sodium Chloride Injection, USP should be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when Sodium Chloride Injection, USP is administered to a nursing mother. Studies have not been conducted to evaluate the effects of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP on labor and delivery. Caution should be exercised when administrating this drug during labor and delivery. The use of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP in pediatric patients is based on clinical practice. Plasma electrolyte concentrations should be closely monitored in the pediatric population as this population may have impaired ability to regulate fluids and electrolytes. Clinical studies of Sodium Chloride Injection, USP did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged 65 and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects. Other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients. In general, dose selection for an elderly patient should be cautious, usually starting at the low end of the dosing range, reflecting the greater frequency of decreased hepatic, renal, or cardiac function, and of concomitant disease or drug therapy. This drug is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney, and the risk of toxic reactions to this drug may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose selection, and it may be useful to monitor renal function. Do not administer unless solution is clear and container is undamaged. Discard unused portion. Reactions which may occur because of the solution or the technique of administration include febrile response, infection at the site of injection, venous thrombosis or phlebitis extending from the site of injection, extravasation and hypervolemia. If an adverse reaction does occur, discontinue the infusion, evaluate the patient, institute appropriate therapeutic countermeasures and save the remainder of the fluid for examination if deemed necessary. In the event of overhydration or solute overload, re-evaluate the patient and institute appropriate corrective measures (see WARNINGS, PRECAUTIONS, and ADVERSE REACTIONS). The dose is dependent upon the age, weight and clinical condition of the patient.Additives may be incompatible. Consult with pharmacist, if available. When introducing additives, use aseptic technique, mix thoroughly and do not store. Parenteral drug products should be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration, whenever solution and container permit (see PRECAUTIONS). Check flexible container solution composition, lot number, and expiry date.Do not remove solution container from its overwrap until immediately before use. Use sterile equipment and aseptic technique. To Open 1. Turn solution container over so that the text is face down. Using the pre-cut corner tabs, peel open the overwrap and remove solution container. 2. Check the solution container for leaks by squeezing firmly. If leaks are found, or if the seal is not intact, discard the solution.3. Do not use if the solution is cloudy or a precipitate is present. To Add Medication The Additive port of the container accepts standard luer lock syringes. Do not use a needle for additions.1.

  "Drug Name: 0.12% CHLORHEXIDINE GLUCONATE ORAL RINSE. Description: ACCLEAN chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse provides antimicrobial activity during oral rinsing. The clinical significance of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse’s antimicrobial activities is not clear. Microbiological sampling of plaque has shown a general reduction of counts of certain assayed bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, ranging from 54–97% through six months use. Use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse in a six month clinical study did not result in any significant changes in bacterial resistance, overgrowth of potentially opportunistic organisms or other adverse changes in the oral microbial ecosystem. Three months after chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use was discontinued, the number of bacteria in plaque had returned to baseline levels and resistance of plaque bacteria to chlorhexidine gluconate was equal to that at baseline. Pharmacokinetics:Pharmacokinetic studies with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse indicate approximately 30% of the active ingredient, chlorhexidine gluconate, is retained in the oral cavity following rinsing. This retained drug is slowly released into the oral fluids. Studies conducted on human subjects and animals demonstrate chlorhexidine gluconate is poorly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The mean plasma level of chlorhexidine gluconate reached a peak of 0.206 mcg/g in humans 30 minutes after they ingested a 300-mg dose of the drug. Detectable levels of chlorhexidine gluconate were not present in the plasma of these subjects 12 hours after the compound was administered. Excretion of chlorhexidine gluconate occurred primarily through the feces (~90%). Less than 1% of the chlorhexidine gluconate ingested by these subjects was excreted in the urine. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is indicated for use between dental visits as part of a professional program for the treatment of gingivitis as characterized by redness and swelling of the gingivae, including gingival bleeding upon probing. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse has not been tested among patients with acute necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis (ANUG). For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, seePRECAUTIONS. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used by persons who are known to be hypersensitive to chlorhexidine gluconate or other formula ingredients. The effect of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse on periodontitis has not been determined. An increase in supragingival calculus was noted in clinical testing in chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users compared with control users. It is not known if chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use results in an increase in subgingival calculus. Calculus deposits should be removed by a dental prophylaxis at intervals not greater than six months. Anaphylaxis, as well as serious allergic reactions, have been reported during postmarketing use with dental products containing chlorhexidine.SEE CONTRAINDICATIONS. General: 1. For patients having coexisting gingivitis and periodontitis, the presence or absence of gingival inflammation following treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should not be used as a major indicator of underlying periodontitis. 2. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse can cause staining of oral surfaces, such as tooth surfaces, restorations, and the dorsum of the tongue. Not all patients will experience a visually significant increase in toothstaining. In clinical testing, 56% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users exhibited a measurable increase in facial anterior stain, compared to 35% of control users after six months; 15% of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse users developed what was judged to be heavy stain, compared to 1% of control users after six months. Stain will be more pronounced in patients who have heavier accumulations of unremoved plaque. Stain resulting from use of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse does not adversely affect health of the gingivae or other oral tissues. Stain can be removed from most tooth surfaces by conventional professional prophylactic techniques. Additional time may be required to complete the prophylaxis. Discretion should be used when prescribing to patients with anterior facial restorations with rough surfaces or margins. If natural stain cannot be removed from these surfaces by a dental prophylaxis, patients should be excluded from chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse treatment if permanent discoloration is unacceptable. Stain in these areas may be difficult to remove by dental prophylaxis and on rare occasions may necessitate replacement of these restorations. 3. Some patients may experience an alteration in taste perception while undergoing treatment with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Rare instances of permanent taste alteration following chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse use have been reported via post-marketing product surveillance. Reproduction studies have been performed in rats and rabbits at chlorhexidine gluconate doses up to 300 mg/kg/day and 40 mg/kg/day, respectively, and have not revealed evidence of harm to the fetus. However, adequate and well-controlled studies in pregnant women have not been done. Because animal reproduction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk, caution should be exercised when chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is administered to nursing women. In parturition and lactation studies with rats, no evidence of impaired parturition or of toxic effects to suckling pups was observed when chlorhexidine gluconate was administered to dams at doses that were over 100 times greater than that which would result from a person's ingesting 30 ml of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse per day. Clinical effectiveness and safety of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse have not been established in children under the age of 18. In a drinking water study in rats, carcinogenic effects were not observed at doses up to 38 mg/kg/day. Mutagenic effects were not observed in two mammalian in vivo mutagenesis studies with chlorhexidine gluconate. The highest doses of chlorhexidine used in a mouse dominant-lethal assay and a hamster cytogenetics test were 1000 mg/kg/day and 250 mg/kg/day, respectively. No evidence of impaired fertility was observed in rats at doses up to 100 mg/kg/day. The most common side effects associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinses are: 1) an increase in staining of teeth and other oral surfaces; 2) an increase in calculus formation; and 3) an alteration in taste perception; see WARNINGS and PRECAUTIONS. Oral irritation and local allergy-type symptoms have been spontaneously reported as side effects associated with the use of chlorhexidine gluconate rinse. The following oral mucosal side effects were reported during placebo-controlled adult clinical trials: aphthous ulcer, grossly obvious gingivitis, trauma, ulceration, erythema, desquamation, coated tongue, keratinization, geographic tongue, mucocele, and short frenum. Each occurred at a frequency of less than 1%. Among post marketing reports, the most frequently reported oral mucosal symptoms associated with chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse are stomatitis, gingivitis, glossitis, ulcer, dry mouth, hypesthesia, glossal edema, and paresthesia. Minor irritation and superficial desquamation of the oral mucosa have been noted in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. There have been cases of parotid gland swelling and inflammation of the salivary glands (sialadenitis) reported in patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Ingestion of 1 or 2 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse by a small child (~10 kg body weight) might result in gastric distress, including nausea, or signs of alcohol intoxication. Medical attention should be sought if more than 4 ounces of chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is ingested by a small child or if signs of alcohol intoxication develop. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse therapy should be initiated directly following a dental prophylaxis. Patients using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse should be reevaluated and given a thorough prophylaxis at intervals no longer than six months. Recommended use is twice daily oral rinsing for 30 seconds, morning and evening after tooth brushing. Usual dosage is 15 ml (1 tablespoon) of undiluted chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Patients should be instructed to not rinse with water, or other mouthwashes, brush teeth, or eat immediately after using chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is not intended for ingestion and should be expectorated after rinsing. Chlorhexidine gluconate oral rinse is supplied as a blue liquid in 4-ounce (118 ml) and 1-pint (473 ml) amber plastic bottles with child-resistant dispensing closures.

Medical and surgical infections caused by anaerobic bacteria sensitive to metronidazole in the treatment of infections,For prophylactic purposes in surgical procedures with a risk of anaerobic infection development,It is indicated in severe intestinal and hepatic amebiasis. Contraindicated in those with hypersensitivity to imidazole derivatives or excipients Solution for infusion. Colourless, for intravenous infusion. Clear and particle-free sterile isotonic solution. Posology and method of administration Dosage/frequency and duration of application: Treatment of medical and surgical infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria: Adults: 1 – 1.5 g/day in 2 or 3 equal doses intravenously. Children: Intravenous single dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day or 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for children aged 8 weeks to 12 years. Depending on the severity of the infection, the daily dose may be increased to 40 mg/kg. The duration of treatment is usually 7 days. Children younger than 8 weeks: 15 mg/kg once daily or 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours. Metronidazole accumulation may occur in neonates younger than 40 weeks gestational age during the first week after birth. Therefore, serum metronidazole concentrations may need to be monitored during the first few days of treatment. Once the patient is able to take the medication orally, treatment should be continued with the same oral dose. Prophylactic treatment in surgical procedures with a risk of anaerobic infection: In this indication, metronidazole should be combined with a drug effective against enterobacteriaceae. Adults: 500 mg by intravenous infusion (administered over 30 to 60 minutes) immediately before surgery and at 8 and 16 hours after surgery. Children under 12 years of age: 20–30 mg/kg as a single dose, 1–2 hours before surgery. In neonates with a gestational age of less than 40 weeks: 10 mg/kg as a single dose before surgery. Severe intestinal amebiasis: Adults: 1.5 g/day (e.g. 3 intravenous infusions of 500 mg per day) Children over 10 years: 400-800 mg 3 times daily for 5-10 days. Children 7-10 years old: 200-400 mg 3 times daily for 5-10 days. Children 3-7 years: 100-200 mg 4 times daily for 5-10 days Children 1-3 years: 100-200 mg 3 times daily for 5-10 days Alternatively, the dose can be adjusted according to body weight. 35-50 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for 5-10 days. The daily dose should not exceed 2400 mg. In hepatic amebiasis, abscess drainage should be applied together with metronidazole treatment during the abscess period. Method of application: 5 ml per minute is administered as an infusion. Additional information regarding special populations: Kidney/Liver failure: In severe hepatic insufficiency, the dose and frequency of administration should be adjusted according to the degree of insufficiency and serum levels of metronidazole. For renal insufficiency , see section 4.4. Pediatric population: Given above. Geriatric population: Caution is recommended in the elderly. Caution should be exercised especially at high doses. Long-term use of TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL in treatment should be carefully evaluated (see section 5.3). In case of longer-than-planned use, regular blood tests should be performed, and leukocytes should be monitored in particular and attention should be paid to the development of neuropathy. Due to the risk of exacerbation of neurological symptoms, active or chronic peripheral or Should be used with caution in patients with central neurological disorders.Patients should be warned not to drink alcohol during treatment and for at least two days after stopping treatment, as it may cause a disulfiram-like reaction.It should be used with caution in patients with blood dyscrasia findings or history. Leukocyte count should be performed before and after treatment. In cases with blood dyscrasia or high dose and/or long-term treatment, the decision on whether to continue treatment should be made according to the severity of the infection. Adverse reactions should be monitored in treatments longer than 10 days. Metronidazole should be used with caution in cases of hepatic encephalopathy. The daily dose should be reduced to one third and used as a single dose.It may darken the urine color due to its metabolites; patients should be informed about this. • Oral, vaginal or intestinal candidiasis after intravenous metronidazole use may develop. It has no direct activity against aerobic and facultative anaerobic bacteria. After Trichomonas vaginalis is eliminated, a gonococcal infection does not remain There is a possibility. In case of renal failure, the elimination half-life of metronidazole does not change. Therefore, there is no need to reduce the dose of metronidazole. However, metronidazole metabolites remain in these patients. The clinical significance of this is unknown. In patients receiving hemodialysis, metronidazole and its metabolites are effectively removed within an 8- hour dialysis period. Therefore, metronidazole should be re-administered immediately after hemodialysis. There is no routine dosage adjustment necessary in patients with renal failure receiving intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) or continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). If ataxia, vertigo, hallucinations or confusion are observed, treatment should be discontinued.Metronidazole potentiates the effect of vecuronium, which is used to create non-depolarizing neuromuscular blockade.Although metronidazole has been found to be carcinogenic in a certain mouse species, this effect has not been demonstrated in rats and hamsters. The preparation has no such effect in humans. Due to insufficient evidence of mutagenicity risk in humans Use of TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL for a longer period than usual should be carefully evaluated. This medicinal product contains 13 mmol sodium per 100 ml. Patients on a low sodium and low salt diet should be careful. It should also be administered with caution to those prone to oedema. Should be stored at room temperature below 25 °C. 1.1. Interactions with other medical products and other forms of interaction Disulfiram: Psychotic reactions have been reported in patients using disulfiram together with metronidazole.Alcohol: In order to avoid a disulfiram-type reaction (redness in the face and neck area, vomiting, tachycardia), alcoholic beverages or medications containing alcohol should not be consumed during treatment and for at least 2 days after the end of treatment.Warfarin: Since metronidazole reduces the destruction of oral anticoagulants in the liver, the effect of these preparations and the risk of hemorrhage may increase when used together. Therefore, in combined use, prothrombin levels should be checked frequently and the oral anticoagulant dose to be applied should be adjusted.Lithium: Plasma levels of lithium may increase when used with metronidazole. Therefore, plasma concentrations of lithium, creatinine and electrolytes should be monitored in patients receiving metronidazole while on lithium therapy. Cyclosporine: Increased serum levels of cyclosporine may occur. If co-administration with metronidazole is necessary, serum cyclosporine and creatinine levels should be closely monitored. Phenytoin-phenobarbital: Elimination of metronidazole may be increased and a decrease in serum levels may be observed.5-fluoro-uracil: When used with metronidazole, the excretion of 5-fluoro-uracil decreases and its toxic effects increase accordingly.Busulfan: Since metronidazole will increase the plasma busulfan amount, serious busulfan may cause toxicity. Interference with laboratory tests: Metronidazole may cause changes in AST (SGOT), ALT (SGPT), LDH, triglycerides, or glucose measurements when measured using the ultraviolet absorbance method. It can be used in children from 8 weeks of age. For necessary dosage adjustment in pediatric patients: Treatment of medical and surgical infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria: Adults: 1 – 1.5 g/day in 2 or 3 equal doses intravenously. Children: Intravenous single dose of 20-30 mg/kg/day or 7.5 mg/kg every 8 hours for children aged 8 weeks to 12 years. Depending on the severity of the infection, the daily dose may be increased to 40 mg/kg. The duration of treatment is usually 7 days. Children younger than 8 weeks: 15 mg/kg once daily or 7.5 mg/kg every 12 hours. Metronidazole accumulation may occur in neonates younger than 40 weeks gestational age during the first week after birth. Therefore, serum metronidazole concentrations may need to be monitored during the first few days of treatment. Once the patient is able to take the medication orally, treatment should be continued with the same oral dose. Prophylactic treatment in surgical procedures with a risk of anaerobic infection: In this indication, metronidazole should be combined with a drug effective against enterobacteriaceae. Adults: 500 mg by intravenous infusion (administered over 30 to 60 minutes) immediately before surgery and at 8 and 16 hours after surgery. Children under 12 years of age: 20–30 mg/kg as a single dose, 1–2 hours before surgery. In neonates with a gestational age of less than 40 weeks: 10 mg/kg as a single dose before surgery. Severe intestinal amebiasis: Adults: 1.5 g/day (e.g. 3 intravenous infusions of 500 mg per day) Children over 10 years: 400-800 mg 3 times daily for 5-10 days. Children 7-10 years old: 200-400 mg 3 times daily for 5-10 days. Children 3-7 years: 100-200 mg 4 times daily for 5-10 days Children 1-3 years: 100-200 mg 3 times daily for 5-10 days Alternatively, the dose can be adjusted according to body weight. 35-50 mg/kg daily in 3 divided doses for 5-10 days. The daily dose should not exceed 2400 mg. In hepatic amebiasis, abscess drainage should be applied together with metronidazole treatment during the abscess period.

Musculoskeletal disorders, connective tissue and bone diseases Very rare: Myalgia, arthralgia Kidney and urinary diseases Very rare: Darkening of urine colour (due to metronidazole metabolite) General disorders and diseases related to the application area Uncommon: Fever Reporting of suspected adverse reactions Reporting of suspected adverse reactions after licensing is of great importance. Reporting allows continuous monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the drug. Healthcare professionals are required to report any suspected adverse reactions to the Turkish Pharmacovigilance Center (TÜFAM) (www.titck.gov.tr ; e-mail: tufam@titck.gov.tr ; tel: 0 800 314 00 08, fax: 0 312 218 35 99). Overdose symptoms include vomiting, ataxia and disorientation. There is no specific antidote. Symptomatic and supportive treatment should be applied. Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antibacterials for systemic use. ATC code: J01XD01 Mechanism of action Metronidazole is an antibiotic from the 5-nitroimidazole group. It is bactericidal, amoebicidal and trichomonocidal. Its antimicrobial mechanism of action is not yet known. It is not ionized at physiological pH and is taken into the cells by anaerobic microorganisms and cells. It is reduced to polar metabolites that do not have nitro groups and are not yet fully identified by electron transport proteins with low redox potential in cells. It is thought that reduced metabolites create an antimicrobial effect by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis and damaging DNA. Metronidazole is equally effective on dividing and non-dividing cells. In vitro and in vivo studies have also shown that metronidazole has a direct anti-inflammatory effect by affecting neutrophil motility, lymphocyte formation and cellular immunity. Antibacterial spectrum of action of metronidazole: Anaerobic bacteria: Metronidazole is effective against many bacteria in vitro : Bacteroides fragilis, B. bivius (Prevotella bivia), B. disiens (Prevotella disiens), B. distasoni, B. gingivalis, (Porphyromonas gingivalis), B. intermedius (Prevotella intermedia), B. melaninogenicus (Prevotella meloninogenica), B. oralis (Prevotella). oralis), B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus, B. asaccharolyticus (Porphyromonas asaccharolytica), B. ureolyticus, Fusobacterium and Veillonella. Some species of Mobiluncus (motile, anaerobic and those with coiled rods) are inhibited by metronidazole in vitro , while other species are considered resistant. Gram positive anaerobic cocci that are effective against the drug are Clostiridium, C. difficile, C. perfringens, Eubacterium, Peptococcus and Peptostreptococcus. Actinomyces, Lactobacillus, Propionibacterium acnes, P. avidum and P. granulosum are known to be resistant. Other microorganisms: Metronidazole is effective against Campylobacter fetus in vitro . Gardnerella vaginalis (Haemophilus vaginalis) is sensitive to high doses of metronidazole. Metronidazole was found to be ineffective against fungi in in vitro studies. Resistance Some strains of Trichomonas vaginalis have developed resistance to metronidazole. Rarely, Bacteroides fragilis and other anaerobic bacteria may also acquire resistance after long-term use. Resistance to metronidazole may be due to poor cell penetration and/or nitroreductase activity. General Features Absorption: Since it is administered by injection, all of the administered medication is transferred to the body. Distribution: The mean serum levels obtained as a result of intravenous infusion of a solution containing 500 mg metronidazole over 20 minutes are 18 mcg/mL. If the same dose is repeated at 8 hour intervals, the serum levels are maintained. If it is repeated at 12 hour intervals, the serum level is 13 mcg/mL. The plasma half-life is 8-10 hours. Protein binding is low (less than 10%). Its distribution is rapid and its concentration is high in the lungs, kidneys, liver, skin, bile, cerebrospinal fluid, saliva, seminal fluid and vaginal secretions. Metronidazole crosses the placenta and breast milk. Biotransformation: It is metabolized in the liver and is found in high concentrations in the liver and bile. Metronidazole is metabolized in the body into two metabolites with antibacterial activity. “Alcohol” metabolite is the primary metabolite. Bactericidal effect against anaerobic bacteria 30% of the potency of metronidazole. Elimination half-life is approximately 11 hours.The “acid” metabolite is present in small amounts and has a bactericidal effect of 5% of metronidazole. There is. Elimination: Excretion occurs mainly via the urine (40-70% of metronidazole excreted unchanged) and therefore the urine may take on a red-brown colour. Metronidazole has been shown to be carcinogenic in mice and rats following chronic oral administration. However, similar studies in hamsters have yielded negative results. Epidemiological studies have shown no clear increase in carcinogenic risk in humans. No evidence was obtained. Therefore, long-term use of TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL in treatment should be carefully evaluated. Metronidazole has been shown to be mutagenic in bacteria in vitro . In vivo human cell culture studies have not provided sufficient evidence of mutagenic effects. Sterile To determine whether the solutions to be used together will not cause any incompatibility. Care should be taken to ensure that the mixture is clear. TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL should not be mixed with cefamendol-naftate, cefoxitin sodium, 10% dextrose, sodium lactate, penicillin G potassium. Shelf life 24 months. TURKFLEKS 0.5% METRONIDAZOL, 100 ml containing 0.5 g/100 ml metronidazole It is offered in polypropylene bags, in sets and unset forms.

Clarithromycin is generally effective in the eradication of S. pyogenes from the nasopharynx; however, data establishing the efficacy of clarithromycin in the subsequent prevention of rheumatic fever are not available at present.) Acute maxillary sinusitis due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae Acute bacterial exacerbation of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Haemophilusparainfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae Community-Acquired Pneumonia due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus, or Streptococcus pyogenes (Abscesses usually require surgical drainage.) Disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium, or Mycobacterium intracellulare Clarithromycin tablets in combination with amoxicillin and lansoprazole or omeprazole delayed-release capsules, as triple therapy, are indicated for the treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or five-year history of duodenal ulcer) to eradicate H. pylori. Clarithromycin tablets in combination with omeprazole capsules or ranitidine bismuth citrate tablets are also indicated for the treatment of patients with an active duodenal ulcer associated with H. pylori infection. However, regimens which contain clarithromycin as the single antimicrobial agent are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance among patients who fail therapy. Clarithromycin-containing regimens should not be used in patients with known or suspected clarithromycin resistant isolates because the efficacy of treatment is reduced in this setting. In patients who fail therapy, susceptibility testing should be done if possible. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated, a non-clarithromycin-containing therapy is recommended. (For information on development of resistance see Microbiology section.) The eradication of H. pylori has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Children Pharyngitis/Tonsillitis due to Streptococcus pyogenes Community-Acquired Pneumonia due to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Streptococcus pneumoniae, or Chlamydia pneumoniae (TWAR) Acute maxillary sinusitis due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae Acute otitis media due to Haemophilusinfluenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis ,or Streptococcus pneumoniae NOTE: For information on otitis media, see CLINICAL STUDIES: Otitis Media .

Disseminated mycobacterial infections due to Mycobacterium avium, or Mycobacterium intracellulare Prophylaxis Clarithromycin tablets are indicated for the prevention of disseminated Mycobacterium avium complex (MAC) disease in patients with advanced HIV infection. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of clarithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, clarithromycin tablets should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy..",

  "Drug Name: Unknown. Description: Indications and Usage Cefizox (ceftizoxime for injection, USP) is indicated in the treatment of infections due to susceptible strains of the microorganisms listed below. Lower Respiratory Tract Infections caused by Klebsiella spp.; Proteus mirabilis ; Escherichia coli; Haemophilus influenzae including ampicillin‐resistant strains; Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase­ and nonpenicillinase‐producing); Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp.; and Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae , but excluding enterococci. Urinary Tract Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase‐ and nonpenicillinase‐producing); Escherichia coli ; Pseudomonas spp. including P. aeruginosa ; Proteus mirabilis ; P. vulgaris ; Providencia rettgeri (formerly Proteus rettgeri ) and Morganella morganii (formerly Proteus morganii ); Klebsiella spp.; Serratia spp. including S. marcescens ; and Enterobacter spp. Gonorrhea including uncomplicated cervical and urethral gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Pelvic Inflammatory Disease caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae, Escherichia coli or Streptococcus agalactiae . NOTE: Ceftizoxime, like other cephalosporins, has no activity against Chlamydia trachomatis . Therefore, when cephalosporins are used in the treatment of patients with pelvic inflammatory disease and C. trachomatis is one of the suspected pathogens, appropriate anti­chlamydial coverage should be added. Intra‐Abdominal Infections caused by Escherichia coli; Staphylococcus epidermidis; Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Enterobacter spp.; Klebsiella spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis ; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Septicemia caused by Streptococcus spp. including S. pneumoniae (but excluding enterococci); Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase‐ and nonpenicillinase‐producing); Escherichia coli; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis ; Klebsiella spp.; and Serratia spp. Skin and Skin Structure Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase‐ and nonpenicillinase‐producing); Staphylococcus epidermidis ; Escherichia coli; Klebsiella spp.; Streptococcus spp. including Streptococcus pyogenes (but excluding enterococci); Proteus mirabilis ; Serratia spp.; Enterobacter spp.; Bacteroides spp. including B. fragilis ; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Bone and Joint Infections caused by Staphylococcus aureus (penicillinase‐ and nonpenicillinase‐producing); Streptococcus spp. (excluding enterococci); Proteus mirabilis ; Bacteroides spp.; and anaerobic cocci, including Peptococcus spp. and Peptostreptococcus spp. Meningitis caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Cefizox has also been used successfully in the treatment of a limited number of pediatric and adult cases of meningitis caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Cefizox has been effective in the treatment of seriously ill, compromised patients, including those who were debilitated, immunosuppressed, or neutropenic. Infections caused by aerobic gram‐negative and by mixtures of organisms resistant to other cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, or penicillins have responded to treatment with Cefizox. Because of the serious nature of some urinary tract infections due to P. aeruginosa and because many strains of Pseudomonas species are only moderately susceptible to Cefizox, higher dosage is recommended. Other therapy should be instituted if the response is not prompt. Susceptibility studies on specimens obtained prior to therapy should be used to determine the response of causative organisms to Cefizox. Therapy with Cefizox may be initiated pending results of the studies; however, treatment should be adjusted according to study findings. In serious infections, Cefizox has been used concomitantly with aminoglycosides (see PRECAUTIONS ). Before using Cefizox concomitantly with other antibiotics, the prescribing information for those agents should be reviewed for contraindications, warnings, precautions, and adverse reactions. Renal function should be carefully monitored. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of Cefizox and other antibacterial drugs, Cefizox should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy..",

  "Drug Name: PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL IMAGE LABEL. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isoniazid is recommended for all forms of tuberculos in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant antituberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculos with isoniazid, or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. Isoniazid is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parenthesis): 1. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (≥ 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin- negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. 2. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (≥ 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (< 5mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of in- fectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (> 5 mm), therapy should be continued. 3. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (≥ 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those < 35 years old; ≥ 15 mm increase for those ≥ 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a > 10 mm skin test are included in this category. 4. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (≥ 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. 5. Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (> 10 mm). 6. Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (≥ 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorti- costeroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin’s disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic under nutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity, the postgastrectomy state (with or without weight loss), chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups: Foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. Medically under served low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. Residents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions). Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have > 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1-6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactors over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1-6) and on an individual basis insituations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected..",

  "Drug Name: Principal Display Panel - 20 mg Citalopram HBr 20 mg* 10 Tablets Bag label. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Citalopram HBr is indicated for the treatment of depression. The efficacy of citalopram HBr in the treatment of depression was established in 4 to 6 week, controlled trials of outpatients whose diagnosis corresponded most closely to the DSM-III and DSM-III-R category of major depressive disorder (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning, and includes at least five of the following nine symptoms: depressed mood, loss of interest in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of citalopram HBr in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of citalopram HBr in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 24 weeks following 6 to 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in two placebo-controlled trials (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use citalopram HBr for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient..",

  "Drug Name: Sertraline Hydrochloride. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Major Depressive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of a major depressive episode was established in six to eight week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III category of major depressive disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). A major depressive episode implies a prominent and relatively persistent depressed or dysphoric mood that usually interferes with daily functioning (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks); it should include at least 4 of the following 8 symptoms: change in appetite, change in sleep, psychomotor agitation or retardation, loss of interest in usual activities or decrease in sexual drive, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, and a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The antidepressant action of sertraline hydrochloride in hospitalized depressed patients has not been adequately studied. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining an antidepressant response for up to 44 weeks following 8 weeks of open-label acute treatment (52 weeks total) was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The usefulness of the drug in patients receiving sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should be reevaluated periodically (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of obsessions and compulsions in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as defined in the DSM-III-R; i.e., the obsessions or compulsions cause marked distress, are time-consuming, or significantly interfere with social or occupational functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in 12-week trials with obsessive-compulsive outpatients having diagnoses of obsessive-compulsive disorder as defined according to DSM-III or DSM-III-R criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Obsessive-compulsive disorder is characterized by recurrent and persistent ideas, thoughts, impulses, or images (obsessions) that are ego-dystonic and/or repetitive, purposeful, and intentional behaviors (compulsions) that are recognized by the person as excessive or unreasonable. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in patients with OCD who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Panic Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of panic disorder in adults, with or without agoraphobia, as defined in DSM-IV. Panic disorder is characterized by the occurrence of unexpected panic attacks and associated concern about having additional attacks, worry about the implications or consequences of the attacks, and/or a significant change in behavior related to the attacks. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride was established in three 10-12 week trials in adult panic disorder patients whose diagnoses corresponded to the DSM-III-R category of panic disorder (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Panic disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by recurrent unexpected panic attacks, i.e., a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which four (or more) of the following symptoms develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes: (1) palpitations, pounding heart, or accelerated heart rate; (2) sweating; (3) trembling or shaking; (4) sensations of shortness of breath or smothering; (5) feeling of choking; (6) chest pain or discomfort; (7) nausea or abdominal distress; (8) feeling dizzy, unsteady, lightheaded, or faint; (9) derealization (feelings of unreality) or depersonalization (being detached from oneself); (10) fear of losing control; (11) fear of dying; (12) paresthesias (numbness or tingling sensations); (13) chills or hot flushes. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response, in adult patients with panic disorder who responded during a 52-week treatment phase while taking Sertraline hydrochloride and were then observed for relapse during a period of up to 28 weeks, was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) – Sertraline hydrochloride (sertraline hydrochloride) is indicated for the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PTSD was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnosis met criteria for the DSM-III-R category of PTSD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). PTSD, as defined by DSM-III-R/IV, requires exposure to a traumatic event that involved actual or threatened death or serious injury, or threat to the physical integrity of self or others, and a response which involves intense fear, helplessness, or horror. Symptoms that occur as a result of exposure to the traumatic event include reexperiencing of the event in the form of intrusive thoughts, flashbacks or dreams, and intense psychological distress and physiological reactivity on exposure to cues to the event; avoidance of situations reminiscent of the traumatic event, inability to recall details of the event, and/or numbing of general responsiveness manifested as diminished interest in significant activities, estrangement from others, restricted range of affect, or sense of foreshortened future; and symptoms of autonomic arousal including hypervigilance, exaggerated startle response, sleep disturbance, impaired concentration, and irritability or outbursts of anger. A PTSD diagnosis requires that the symptoms are present for at least a month and that they cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with PTSD for up to 28 weeks following 24 weeks of open-label treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder (PMDD) – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD) in adults. The efficacy of sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of PMDD was established in 2 placebo-controlled trials of female adult outpatients treated for 3 menstrual cycles who met criteria for the DSM-IIIR/IV category of PMDD (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). The essential features of PMDD include markedly depressed mood, anxiety or tension, affective lability, and persistent anger or irritability. Other features include decreased interest in activities, difficulty concentrating, lack of energy, change in appetite or sleep, and feeling out of control. Physical symptoms associated with PMDD include breast tenderness, headache, joint and muscle pain, bloating and weight gain. These symptoms occur regularly during the luteal phase and remit within a few days following onset of menses; the disturbance markedly interferes with work or school or with usual social activities and relationships with others. In making the diagnosis, care should be taken to rule out other cyclical mood disorders that may be exacerbated by treatment with an antidepressant. The effectiveness of Sertraline hydrochloride in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 menstrual cycles, has not been systematically evaluated in controlled trials. Therefore, the physician who elects to use Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Social Anxiety Disorder – Sertraline hydrochloride is indicated for the treatment of social anxiety disorder, also known as social phobia in adults. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in the treatment of social anxiety disorder was established in two placebo-controlled trials of adult outpatients with a diagnosis of social anxiety disorder as defined by DSM-IV criteria (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY ). Social anxiety disorder, as defined by DSM-IV, is characterized by marked and persistent fear of social or performance situations involving exposure to unfamiliar people or possible scrutiny by others and by fears of acting in a humiliating or embarrassing way. Exposure to the feared social situation almost always provokes anxiety and feared social or performance situations are avoided or else are endured with intense anxiety or distress. In addition, patients recognize that the fear is excessive or unreasonable and the avoidance and anticipatory anxiety of the feared situation is associated with functional impairment or marked distress. The efficacy of Sertraline hydrochloride in maintaining a response in adult patients with social anxiety disorder for up to 24 weeks following 20 weeks of Sertraline hydrochloride treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. Physicians who prescribe Sertraline hydrochloride for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see Clinical Trials under CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY )..",

Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Severe Recalcitrant Nodular Acne Amnesteem is indicated for the treatment of severe recalcitrant nodular acne. Nodules are inflammatory lesions with a diameter of 5 mm or greater. The nodules may become suppurative or hemorrhagic. “Severe,” by definition, 2 means “many” as opposed to “few or several” nodules. Because of significant adverse effects associated with its use, Amnesteem should be reserved for patients with severe nodular acne who are unresponsive to conventional therapy, including systemic antibiotics . In addition, Amnesteem is indicated only for those female patients who are not pregnant, because Amnesteem can cause severe birth defects (see Boxed CONTRAINDICATIONS AND WARNINGS ). A single course of therapy for 15 to 20 weeks has been shown to result in complete and prolonged remission of disease in many patients. 1,3,4 If a second course of therapy is needed, it should not be initiated until at least 8 weeks after completion of the first course, because experience has shown that patients may continue to improve while off Amnesteem. The optimal interval before retreatment has not been defined for patients who have not completed skeletal growth (see WARNINGS: Skeletal: Bone Mineral Density , Hyperostosis , and Premature Epiphyseal Closure )..",

  "Drug Name: PACKAGE LABEL.PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL SECTION DRUG: Lisinopril GENERIC: LISINOPRIL DOSAGE: TABLET ADMINSTRATION: ORAL NDC: 52125-213-02 STRENGTH:5 mg COLOR: white SHAPE: SQUARE SCORE: Two even pieces SIZE: 6 mm IMPRINT: 30 QTY: 30 MM8 MM9. Description: INDICATIONS & USAGE Hypertension Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hypertension to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including lisinopril. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education ProgramJoint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in Black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Lisinopril tablets USP may be administered alone or with other antihypertensive agents Heart Failure Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated as adjunctive therapy in the management of heart failure in patients who are not responding adequately to diuretics and digitalis. Acute Myocardial Infarction Lisinopril tablets USP are indicated for the treatment of hemodynamically stable patients within 24 hours of acute myocardial infarction, to improve survival. Patients should receive, as appropriate, the standard recommended treatments such as thrombolytics, aspirin and beta-blockers. In using lisinopril tablets USP, consideration should be given to the fact that another angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril, has caused agranulocytosis, particularly in patients with renal impairment or collagen vascular disease, and that available data are insufficient to show that lisinopril tablets USP do not have a similar risk (see WARNINGS). In considering the use of lisinopril tablets USP, it should be noted that in controlled clinical trials, ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in Black patients than in non-Blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors have been associated with a higher rate of angioedema in Black than in non-Black patients (see WARNINGS, Anaphylactoid and Possibly Related Reactions)..",

Haloperidol is indicated for the control of tics and vocal utterances of Tourette’s Disorder in children and adults. Haloperidol is effective for the treatment of severe behavior problems in children of combative, explosive hyperexcitability (which cannot be accounted for by immediate provocation). Haloperidol is also effective in the short-term treatment of hyperactive children who show excessive motor activity with accompanying conduct disorders consisting of some or all of the following symptoms: impulsivity, difficulty sustaining attention, aggressivity, mood lability, and poor frustration tolerance. Haloperidol should be reserved for these two groups of children only after failure to respond to psychotherapy or medications other than antipsychotics..",
  "Drug Name: Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Phenazopyridine HCl is indicated for the symptomatic relief of pain, burning, urgency, frequency, and other discomforts arising from irritation of the lower urinary tract mucosa caused by infection, trauma, surgery, endoscopic procedures, or the passage of sounds or catheters. The use of Phenazopyridine HCl for relief of symptoms should not delay definitive diagnosis and treatment of causative conditions. Because it provides only symptomatic relief, prompt appropriate treatment of the cause of pain must be instituted and Phenazopyridine HCl should be discontinued when symptoms are controlled. The analgesic action may reduce or eliminate the need for systemic analgesics or narcotics. It is, however, compatible with antibacterial therapy and can help to relieve pain and discomfort during the interval before antibacterial therapy controls the infection. Treatment of a urinary tract infection with Phenazopyridine HCl should not exceed 2 days because there is a lack of evidence that the combined administration of Phenazopyridine HCl and an antibacterial provides greater benefit than administration of the antibacterial alone after 2 days. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION section.).",

Efficacy was established in three clinical trials in adult patients with schizophrenia: two 6-week trials and one maintenance trial. In adolescent patients with schizophrenia (ages 13-17), efficacy was established in one 6-week trial [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )] . When deciding among the alternative treatments available for adolescents, clinicians should consider the increased potential (in adolescents as compared with adults) for weight gain and dyslipidemia. Clinicians should consider the potential long-term risks when prescribing to adolescents, and in many cases this may lead them to consider prescribing other drugs first in adolescents [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.5 ] . 1.2 Bipolar I Disorder (Manic or Mixed Episodes) Monotherapy — Oral olanzapine is indicated for the acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder and maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder.

For pediatric schizophrenia, symptom profiles can be variable, and for bipolar I disorder, pediatric patients may have variable patterns of periodicity of manic or mixed symptoms. It is recommended that medication therapy for pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder be initiated only after a thorough diagnostic evaluation has been performed and careful consideration given to the risks associated with medication treatment. Medication treatment for both pediatric schizophrenia and bipolar I disorder should be part of a total treatment program that often includes psychological, educational and social interventions. 1.5 Olanzapine and Fluoxetine in Combination: Depressive Episodes Associated with Bipolar I Disorder Oral olanzapine and fluoxetine in combination is indicated for the treatment of depressive episodes associated with bipolar I disorder, based on clinical studies.

  "Drug Name: PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL Principal Display Panel-Atenolol Tablets, USP 100mg. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Atenolol tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Atenolol tablets may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Atenolol tablets are indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris. Acute Myocardial Infarction Atenolol tablets are indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS .) In general, there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit..",

For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Nadolol Tablets USP may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide-type diuretics..",

  "Drug Name: Azithromycin. Description: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for the treatment of patients with mild to moderate infections caused by susceptible strains of the designated microorganisms in the specific conditions listed below. Recommended dosages and durations of therapy in adult and pediatric patient populations vary in these indications. [see Dosage and Administration (2) ] Azithromycin is a macrolide antibacterial drug indicated for mild to moderate infections caused by designated, susceptible bacteria: • Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Acute bacterial sinusitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections in adults ( 1.1 ) • Urethritis and cervicitis in adults ( 1.1 ) • Genital ulcer disease in men ( 1.1 ) • Acute otitis media in pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) ( 1.2 ) • Community-acquired pneumonia in adults and pediatric patients (6 months of age and older) ( 1.1 , 1.2 ) • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis in adults and pediatric patients (2 years of age and older) ( 1.1 , 1.2 ) Limitation of Use: Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors. ( 1.3 ) To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. ( 1.4 ) 1.1 Adult Patients • Acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis, or Streptococcus pneumoniae . • Acute bacterial sinusitis due to Haemophilus influenzae , Moraxella catarrhalis. or Streptococcus pneumoniae . • Community-acquired pneumonia due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae , Haemophilus influenzae , Mycoplasma pneumoniae, or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy. • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy. • Uncomplicated skin and skin structure infections due to Staphylococcus aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , or Streptococcus agalactiae . • Urethritis and cervicitis due to Chlamydia trachomatis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae . • Genital ulcer disease in men due to Haemophilus ducreyi (chancroid). Due to the small number of women included in clinical trials, the efficacy of azithromycin in the treatment of chancroid in women has not been established. 1.2 Pediatric Patients [see Use in Specific Populations (8.4) and Clinical Studies (14.2) ] • Acute otitis media (>6 months of age) caused by Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis , or Streptococcus pneumoniae. • Community-acquired pneumonia (>6 months of age) due to Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Mycoplasma pneumoniae , or Streptococcus pneumoniae in patients appropriate for oral therapy. • Pharyngitis/tonsillitis (>2 years of age) caused by Streptococcus pyogenes as an alternative to first-line therapy in individuals who cannot use first-line therapy. 1.3 Limitations of Use Azithromycin should not be used in patients with pneumonia who are judged to be inappropriate for oral therapy because of moderate to severe illness or risk factors such as any of the following: • patients with cystic fibrosis, • patients with nosocomial infections, • patients with known or suspected bacteremia, • patients requiring hospitalization, • elderly or debilitated patients, or • patients with significant underlying health problems that may compromise their ability to respond to their illness (including immunodeficiency or functional asplenia). 1.4 Usage To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain the effectiveness of azithromycin tablets and other antibacterial drugs, azithromycin tablets should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy..",
  "Drug Name: Divalproex Sodium. Description: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are indicated for: • Acute treatment of manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features ( 1.1 ) • Monotherapy and adjunctive therapy of complex partial seizures and simple and complex absence seizures; adjunctive therapy in patients with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures ( 1.2 ) • Prophylaxis of migraine headaches ( 1.3 ) 1.1 Mania Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are a valproate and are indicated for the treatment of acute manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar disorder, with or without psychotic features. A manic episode is a distinct period of abnormally and persistently elevated, expansive, or irritable mood. Typical symptoms of mania include pressure of speech, motor hyperactivity, reduced need for sleep, flight of ideas, grandiosity, poor judgment, aggressiveness, and possible hostility. A mixed episode is characterized by the criteria for a manic episode in conjunction with those for a major depressive episode (depressed mood, loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities). The efficacy of divalproex sodium extended-release tablets is based in part on studies of divalproex sodium delayed-release tablets in this indication, and was confirmed in a 3-week trial with patients meeting DSM-IV TR criteria for bipolar I disorder, manic or mixed type, who were hospitalized for acute mania [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] . The effectiveness of valproate for long-term use in mania, i.e., more than 3 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials. Therefore, healthcare providers who elect to use divalproex sodium extended-release tablets for extended periods should continually reevaluate the long-term risk-benefits of the drug for the individual patient. 1.2 Epilepsy Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are indicated as monotherapy and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of adult patients and pediatric patients down to the age of 10 years with complex partial seizures that occur either in isolation or in association with other types of seizures. Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are also indicated for use as sole and adjunctive therapy in the treatment of simple and complex absence seizures in adults and children 10 years of age or older, and adjunctively in adults and children 10 years of age or older with multiple seizure types that include absence seizures. Simple absence is defined as very brief clouding of the sensorium or loss of consciousness accompanied by certain generalized epileptic discharges without other detectable clinical signs. Complex absence is the term used when other signs are also present. 1.3 Migraine Divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are indicated for prophylaxis of migraine headaches. There is no evidence that divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are useful in the acute treatment of migraine headaches. 1.4 Important Limitations Because of the risk to the fetus of decreased IQ, neurodevelopmental disorders, neural tube defects, and other major congenital malformations, which may occur very early in pregnancy, valproate should not be used to treat women with epilepsy or bipolar disorder who are pregnant or who plan to become pregnant unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable. Valproate should not be administered to a woman of childbearing potential unless other medications have failed to provide adequate symptom control or are otherwise unacceptable [see Warnings and Precautions (5.2 , 5.3 , 5.4) , Use in Specific Populations (8.1) , and Patient Counseling Information (17) ] . For prophylaxis of migraine headaches, divalproex sodium extended-release tablets are contraindicated in women who are pregnant and in women of childbearing potential who are not using effective contraception [see Contraindications (4) ] ..",

  "Drug Name: Metoclopramide. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE The use of Metoclopramide Oral Solution is recommended for adults only. Therapy should not exceed 12 weeks in duration. Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Metoclopramide Oral Solution is indicated as short-term (4 to 12 weeks) therapy for adults with symptomatic, documented gastroesophageal reflux who fail to respond to conventional therapy. The principal effect of metoclopramide is on symptoms of post-prandial and daytime heartburn with less observed effect on nocturnal symptoms. If symptoms are confined to particular situations, such as following the evening meal, use of metoclopramide as single doses prior to the provocative situation should be considered, rather than using the drug throughout the day. Healing of esophageal ulcers and erosions has been endoscopically demonstrated at the end of 12-week trial using doses of 15 mg 4 times daily. As there is no documented correlation between symptoms and healing of esophageal lesions, patients with documented lesions should be monitored endoscopically. Diabetic Gastroparesis (Diabetic Gastric Stasis) Metoclopramide is indicated for the relief of symptoms associated with acute and recurrent diabetic gastric stasis. The usual manifestations of delayed gastric emptying (e.g., nausea, vomiting, heartburn, persistent fullness after meals, and anorexia) appear to respond to metoclopramide within different time intervals. Significant relief of nausea occurs early and continues to improve over a three-week period. Relief of vomiting and anorexia may precede the relief of abdominal fullness by one week or more..",

Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) for extended periods should periodically reevaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient. Seasonal Affective Disorder: Bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) are indicated for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes in patients with a diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder. The efficacy of bupropion hydrochloride extended-release tablets (XL) for the prevention of seasonal major depressive episodes was established in 3 controlled trials of adult outpatients with a history of major depressive disorder with an autumn-winter seasonal pattern as defined by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition (DSM-IV) criteria (see CLINICAL TRIALS ). Seasonal affective disorder is characterized by recurrent major depressive episodes, most commonly occurring during the autumn and/or winter months. Episodes may last up to 6 months in duration, typically beginning in the autumn and remitting in the springtime. Although patients with seasonal affective disorder may have depressive episodes during other times of the year, the diagnosis of seasonal affective disorder requires that the number of seasonal episodes substantially outnumber the number of non-seasonal episodes during the individual's lifetime..",

  "Drug Name: Amlodipine Besylate. Description: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Amlodipine besylate tablets are calcium channel blocker and may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive and antianginal agents for the treatment of: •Hypertension ( 1.1 ) о Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. •Coronary Artery Disease ( 1.2 ) о Chronic Stable Angina о Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) о Angiographically Documented Coronary Artery Disease in patients without heart failure or an ejection fraction < 40% 1.1 Hypertension Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including amlodipine besylate. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antihypertensive agents. 1.2 Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) Chronic Stable Angina Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the symptomatic treatment of chronic stable angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used alone or in combination with other antianginal agents. Vasospastic Angina (Prinzmetal's or Variant Angina) Amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated for the treatment of confirmed or suspected vasospastic angina. Amlodipine besylate tablets may be used as monotherapy or in combination with other antianginal agents. Angiographically Documented CAD In patients with recently documented CAD by angiography and without heart failure or an ejection fraction <40%, amlodipine besylate tablets are indicated to reduce the risk of hospitalization for angina and to reduce the risk of a coronary revascularization procedure..",

Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of doxycycline and other antibacterial drugs, doxycycline should be used only to treat or prevent infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria. When culture and susceptibility information are available, they should be considered in selecting or modifying antibacterial therapy. In the absence of such data, local epidemiology and susceptibility patterns may contribute to the empiric selection of therapy. Treatment: Doxycycline is indicated for the treatment of the following infections: Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus fever and the typhus group, Q fever, rickettsialpox, and tick fevers caused by Rickettsiae. Respiratory tract infections caused by Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Lymphogranuloma venereum caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Psittacosis (ornithosis) caused by Chlamydophila psittaci . Trachoma caused by Chlamydia trachomatis , although the infectious agent is not always eliminated, as judged by immunofluorescence. Inclusion conjunctivitis caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Uncomplicated urethral, endocervical, or rectal infections in adults caused by Chlamydia trachomatis . Nongonococcal urethritis caused by Ureaplasma urealyticum . Relapsing fever due to Borrelia recurrentis . Doxycycline is also indicated for the treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative microorganisms: Chancroid caused by Haemophilus ducreyi . Plague due to Yersinia pestis . Tularemia due to Francisella tularensis . Cholera caused by Vibrio cholerae . Campylobacter fetus infections caused by Campylobacter fetus . Brucellosis due to Brucella species (in conjunction with streptomycin). Bartonellosis due to Bartonella bacilliformis . Granuloma inguinale caused by Klebsiella granulomatis . Because many strains of the following groups of microorganisms have been shown to be resistant to doxycycline, culture and susceptibility testing are recommended. Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-negative bacteria, when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Escherichia coli . Enterobacter aerogenes . Shigella species. Acinetobacter species. Respiratory tract infections caused by Haemophilus influenzae . Respiratory tract and urinary tract infections caused by Klebsiella species. Doxycycline is indicated for treatment of infections caused by the following gram-positive microorganisms when bacteriologic testing indicates appropriate susceptibility to the drug: Upper respiratory infections caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae . Anthrax due to Bacillus anthracis , including inhalational anthrax (post-exposure): to reduce the incidence or progression of disease following exposure to aerosolized Bacillus anthracis . When penicillin is contraindicated, doxycycline is an alternative drug in the treatment of the following infections: Uncomplicated gonorrhea caused by Neisseria gonorrhoeae . Syphilis caused by Treponema pallidum . Yaws caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue . Listeriosis due to Listeria monocytogenes . Vincent's infection caused by Fusobacterium fusiforme . Actinomycosis caused by Actinomyces israelii . Infections caused by Clostridium species. In acute intestinal amebiasis, doxycycline may be a useful adjunct to amebicides. In severe acne, doxycycline may be useful adjunctive therapy. Prophylaxis: Doxycycline is indicated for the prophylaxis of malaria due to Plasmodium falciparum in short-term travelers (< 4 months) to areas with chloroquine and/or pyrimethamine-sulfadoxine resistant strains.

  "Drug Name: PACKAGE/LABEL PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL container label. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Isoniazid oral solution is recommended for all forms of tuberculosis in which organisms are susceptible. However, active tuberculosis must be treated with multiple concomitant antituberculosis medications to prevent the emergence of drug resistance. Single-drug treatment of active tuberculosis with isoniazid, or any other medication, is inadequate therapy. Isoniazid oral solution is recommended as preventive therapy for the following groups, regardless of age. (Note: the criterion for a positive reaction to a skin test (in millimeters of induration) for each group is given in parentheses): 1. Persons with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (greater than or equal to 5 mm) and persons with risk factors for HIV infection whose HIV infection status is unknown but who are suspected of having HIV infection. Preventive therapy may be considered for HIV infected persons who are tuberculin-negative but belong to groups in which the prevalence of tuberculosis infection is high. Candidates for preventive therapy who have HIV infection should have a minimum of 12 months of therapy. 2. Close contacts of persons with newly diagnosed infectious tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). In addition, tuberculin-negative (less than 5 mm) children and adolescents who have been close contacts of infectious persons within the past 3 months are candidates for preventive therapy until a repeat tuberculin skin test is done 12 weeks after contact with the infectious source. If the repeat skin test is positive (greater than 5 mm), therapy should be continued. 3. Recent converters, as indicated by a tuberculin skin test (greater than or equal to 10 mm increase within a 2-year period for those less than 35 years old; greater than or equal to 15 mm increase for those greater than or equal to 35 years of age). All infants and children younger than 4 years of age with a greater than 10 mm skin test are included in this category. 4. Persons with abnormal chest radiographs that show fibrotic lesions likely to represent old healed tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 5 mm). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. 5. Intravenous drug users known to be HIV-seronegative (greater than 10 mm). 6. Persons with the following medical conditions that have been reported to increase the risk of tuberculosis (greater than or equal to 10 mm): silicosis; diabetes mellitus; prolonged therapy with adrenocorticosteroids; immunosuppressive therapy; some hematologic and reticuloendothelial diseases, such as leukemia or Hodgkin's disease; end-stage renal disease; clinical situations associated with substantial rapid weight loss or chronic undernutrition (including: intestinal bypass surgery for obesity. the postgastrectomy state (with or without weight loss), chronic peptic ulcer disease, chronic malabsorption syndromes, and carcinomas of the oropharynx and upper gastrointestinal tract that prevent adequate nutritional intake). Candidates for preventive therapy who have fibrotic pulmonary lesions consistent with healed tuberculosis or who have pulmonary silicosis should have 12 months of isoniazid or 4 months of isoniazid and rifampin, concomitantly. Additionally, in the absence of any of the above risk factors, persons under the age of 35 with a tuberculin skin test reaction of 10 mm or more are also appropriate candidates for preventive therapy if they are a member of any of the following high-incidence groups: 1. Foreign-born persons from high-prevalence countries who never received BCG vaccine. 2. Medically underserved low-income populations, including high-risk racial or ethnic minority populations, especially blacks, Hispanics, and Native Americans. 3. Residents of facilities for long-term care (e.g., correctional institutions, nursing homes, and mental institutions). Children who are less than 4 years old are candidates for isoniazid preventive therapy if they have greater than 10 mm induration from a PPD Mantoux tuberculin skin test. Finally, persons under the age of 35 who a) have none of the above risk factors (1 thru 6); b) belong to none of the high-incidence groups; and c) have a tuberculin skin test reaction of 15 mm or more, are appropriate candidates for preventive therapy. The risk of hepatitis must be weighed against the risk of tuberculosis in positive tuberculin reactions over the age of 35. However, the use of isoniazid is recommended for those with the additional risk factors listed above (1 to 6) and on an individual basis in situations where there is likelihood of serious consequences to contacts who may become infected..",

  "Drug Name: Ketorolac Tromethamine. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Carefully consider the potential benefits and risks of ketorolac tromethamine and other treatment options before deciding to use ketorolac. Use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals (see WARNINGS ). Acute Pain in Adult Patients Ketorolac tromethamine is indicated for the short-term (≤5 days) management of moderately severe acute pain that requires analgesia at the opioid level, usually in a postoperative setting. Therapy should always be initiated with intravenous or intramuscular dosing of ketorolac tromethamine, and oral ketorolac tromethamine is to be used only as continuation treatment, if necessary. The total combined duration of use of ketorolac tromethamine injection and oral ketorolac tromethamine is not to exceed 5 days of use because of the potential of increasing the frequency and severity of adverse reactions associated with the recommended doses (see WARNINGS , PRECAUTIONS , DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , and ADVERSE REACTIONS ). Patients should be switched to alternative analgesics as soon as possible, but ketorolac tromethamine therapy is not to exceed 5 days. Ketorolac tromethamine injection has been used concomitantly with morphine and meperidine and has shown an opioid-sparing effect. For breakthrough pain, it is recommended to supplement the lower end of the ketorolac tromethamine injection dosage range with low doses of narcotics prn, unless otherwise contraindicated. Ketorolac tromethamine injection and narcotics should not be administered in the same syringe (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION – Pharmaceutical Information for Ketorolac Tromethamine Injection )..",

Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient’s clinical condition allows. (See DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ). In general, there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade.

  "Drug Name: PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL BuPIRone_HCl_Tabs_5mg_100UD. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Buspirone hydrochloride tablets are indicated for the management of anxiety disorders or the short-term relief of the symptoms of anxiety. Anxiety or tension associated with the stress of everyday life usually does not require treatment with an anxiolytic. The efficacy of buspirone has been demonstrated in controlled clinical trials of outpatients whose diagnosis roughly corresponds to Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). Many of the patients enrolled in these studies also had coexisting depressive symptoms and buspirone relieved anxiety in the presence of these coexisting depressive symptoms. The patients evaluated in these studies had experienced symptoms for periods of 1 month to over 1 year prior to the study, with an average symptom duration of 6 months. Generalized Anxiety Disorder (300.02) is described in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, lll1 as follows: Generalized, persistent anxiety (of at least 1 month continual duration), manifested by symptoms from three of the four following categories: Motor tension: shakiness, jitteriness, jumpiness, trembling, tension, muscle aches, fatigability, inability to relax, eyelid twitch, furrowed brow, strained face, fidgeting, restlessness, easy startle. Autonomic hyperactivity: sweating, heart pounding or racing, cold, clammy hands, dry mouth, dizziness, lightheadedness, paresthesias (tingling in hands or feet), upset stomach, hot or cold spells, frequent urination, diarrhea, discomfort in the pit of the stomach, lump in the throat, flushing, pallor, high resting pulse, and respiration rate. Apprehensive expectation: anxiety, worry, fear, rumination, and anticipation of misfortune to self or others. Vigilance and scanning: hyperattentiveness resulting in distractibility, difficulty in concentrating, insomnia, feeling “on edge”, irritability, impatience. The above symptoms would not be due to another mental disorder, such as a depressive disorder or schizophrenia. However, mild depressive symptoms are common in GAD. The effectiveness of buspirone in long-term use, that is, for more than 3 to 4 weeks, has not been demonstrated in controlled trials. There is no body of evidence available that systematically addresses the appropriate duration of treatment for GAD. However, in a study of long-term use, 264 patients were treated with buspirone for 1 year without ill effect. Therefore, the physician who elects to use buspirone for extended periods should periodically reassess the usefulness of the drug for the individual patient..",

Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Major Depressive Disorder Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the treatment of major depressive disorder was established in 8 and 12 week controlled trials of adult outpatients whose diagnoses corresponded most closely to the DSM-III-R or DSM-IV category of major depressive disorder (see Clinical Trials ). A major depressive episode (DSM-IV) implies a prominent and relatively persistent (nearly every day for at least 2 weeks) depressed mood or the loss of interest or pleasure in nearly all activities, representing a change from previous functioning, and includes the presence of at least five of the following nine symptoms during the same two week period: depressed mood, markedly diminished interest or pleasure in usual activities, significant change in weight and/or appetite, insomnia or hypersomnia, psychomotor agitation or retardation, increased fatigue, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, slowed thinking or impaired concentration, a suicide attempt or suicidal ideation. The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride tablets in the treatment of major depressive disorder in adult inpatients meeting diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder with melancholia was established in a 4 week controlled trial (see Clinical Trials ). The safety and efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in hospitalized depressed patients have not been adequately studied. The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in maintaining a response in major depressive disorder for up to 26 weeks following 8 weeks of acute treatment was demonstrated in a placebo-controlled trial. The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride tablets in maintaining a response in patients with recurrent major depressive disorder who had responded and continued to be improved during an initial 26 weeks of treatment and were then followed for a period of up to 52 weeks was demonstrated in a second placebo-controlled trial (see Clinical Trials ). Nevertheless, the physician who elects to use venlafaxine hydrochloride tablets/venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION ). Social Anxiety Disorder Venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules are indicated for the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder, also known as Social Phobia, as defined in DSM-IV (300.23). Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) is characterized by a marked and persistent fear of 1 or more social or performance situations in which the person is exposed to unfamiliar people or to possible scrutiny by others. Exposure to the feared situation almost invariably provokes anxiety, which may approach the intensity of a panic attack. The feared situations are avoided or endured with intense anxiety or distress. The avoidance, anxious anticipation, or distress in the feared situation(s) interferes significantly with the person’s normal routine, occupational or academic functioning, or social activities or relationships, or there is a marked distress about having the phobias. Lesser degrees of performance anxiety or shyness generally do not require psychopharmacological treatment. The efficacy of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules in the treatment of Social Anxiety Disorder was established in four 12 week and one 6 month placebocontrolled trials in adult outpatients with Social Anxiety Disorder (DSM-IV) (see Clinical Trials ). Although the effectiveness of venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules has been demonstrated in a 6 month clinical trial in patients with Social Anxiety Disorder, the physician who elects to use venlafaxine hydrochloride extended-release capsules for extended periods should periodically re-evaluate the long-term usefulness of the drug for the individual patient (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION )..",

  "Drug Name: PACKAGE LABEL.PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL pdp. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Hypertension Atenolol is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure lowers the risk of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes including atenolol. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than 1 drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program's Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Atenolol may be administered with other antihypertensive agents. Angina Pectoris Due to Coronary Atherosclerosis Atenolol is indicated for the long-term management of patients with angina pectoris. Acute Myocardial Infarction Atenolol is indicated in the management of hemodynamically stable patients with definite or suspected acute myocardial infarction to reduce cardiovascular mortality. Treatment can be initiated as soon as the patient's clinical condition allows (see DOSAGE AND ADMINISTRATION , CONTRAINDICATIONS , and WARNINGS ). In general, there is no basis for treating patients like those who were excluded from the ISIS-1 trial (blood pressure less than 100 mm Hg systolic, heart rate less than 50 bpm) or have other reasons to avoid beta blockade. As noted above, some subgroups (e.g., elderly patients with systolic blood pressure below 120 mm Hg) seemed less likely to benefit..",

Most patients heal within four weeks. Some patients may require an additional four weeks of therapy. 1.2 Helicobacter pylori Eradication to Reduce the Risk of Duodenal Ulcer Recurrence Eradication of H. pylori has been shown to reduce the risk of duodenal ulcer recurrence. Triple Therapy Omeprazole delayed-release capsules in combination with clarithromycin and amoxicillin, is indicated for treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease (active or up to 1-year history) to eradicate H. pylori in adults. Dual Therapy Omeprazole delayed-release capsules in combination with clarithromycin are indicated for treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease to eradicate H. pylori in adults. Among patients who fail therapy, Omeprazole delayed-release capsules with clarithromycin are more likely to be associated with the development of clarithromycin resistance as compared with triple therapy. In patients who fail therapy, susceptibility testing should be done. If resistance to clarithromycin is demonstrated or susceptibility testing is not possible, alternative antimicrobial therapy should be instituted [see Clinical Pharmacology (12.4) and the clarithromycin prescribing information, Microbiology section ]. 1.3 Treatment of Active Benign Gastric Ulcer Omeprazole delayed-release capsules are indicated for short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) of active benign gastric ulcer in adults. 1.4 Treatment of Symptomatic Gastroesophageal Reflux Disease (GERD) Omeprazole is indicated for the treatment of heartburn and other symptoms associated with GERD for up to 4 weeks in patients 2 years of age and older. 1.5 Treatment of Erosive Esophagitis (EE) Due to Acid-Mediated GERD Pediatric Patients 2 Years of Age to Adults Omeprazole is indicated for the short-term treatment (4 to 8 weeks) of EE due to acid-mediated GERD that has been diagnosed by endoscopy in patients 2 years of age and older.

  "Drug Name: METRONIDAZOLE Label Image. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Symptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated for the treatment of T. vaginalis infection in females and males when the presence of the trichomonad has been confirmed by appropriate laboratory procedures (wet smears and/or cultures). Asymptomatic Trichomoniasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of asymptomatic T. vaginalis infection in females when the organism is associated with endocervicitis, cervicitis, or cervical erosion. Since there is evidence that presence of the trichomonad can interfere with accurate assessment of abnormal cytological smears, additional smears should be performed after eradication of the parasite. Treatment of Asymptomatic Sexual Partners. T. vaginalis infection is a venereal disease. Therefore, asymptomatic sexual partners of treated patients should be treated simultaneously if the organism has been found to be present, in order to prevent reinfection of the partner. The decision as to whether to treat an asymptomatic male partner who has a negative culture or one for whom no culture has been attempted is an individual one. In making this decision, it should be noted that there is evidence that a woman may become reinfected if her sexual partner is not treated. Also, since there can be considerable difficulty in isolating the organism from the asymptomatic male carrier, negative smears and cultures cannot be relied upon in this regard. In any event, the sexual partner should be treated with metronidazole tablets in cases of reinfection. Amebiasis. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of acute intestinal amebiasis (amebic dysentery) and amebic liver abscess. In amebic liver abscess, metronidazole tablets therapy does not obviate the need for aspiration or drainage of pus. Anaerobic Bacterial Infections. Metronidazole tablets are indicated in the treatment of serious infections caused by susceptible anaerobic bacteria. Indicated surgical procedures should be performed in conjunction with metronidazole tablets therapy. In a mixed aerobic and anaerobic infection, antimicrobials appropriate for the treatment of the aerobic infection should be used in addition to metronidazole tablets. INTRA-ABDOMINAL INFECTIONS, including peritonitis, intra-abdominal abscess, and liver abscess, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group ( B. fragilis, B. distasonis, B. ovatus, B. thetaiotaomicron, B. vulgatus ), Clostridium species, Eubacterium species, Peptococcus species, and Peptostreptococcus species. SKIN AND SKIN STRUCTURE INFECTIONS caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. GYNECOLOGIC INFECTIONS, including endometritis, endomyometritis, tubo-ovarian abscess, and postsurgical vaginal cuff infection, caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, Peptococcus species, Peptostreptococcus species, and Fusobacterium species. BACTERIAL SEPTICEMIA caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group and Clostridium species. BONE AND JOINT INFECTIONS, (as adjunctive therapy), caused by Bacteroides species including the B. fragilis group.

Description: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When deciding among the alternative treatments available for the condition needing treatment, the prescriber should consider the finding of ziprasidone’s greater capacity to prolong the QT/QTc interval compared to several other antipsychotic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions (5.3)]. Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointes-type arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether ziprasidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 )]. Schizophrenia Ziprasidone is indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 )]. Bipolar I Disorder (Acute Mixed or Manic Episodes and Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate) Ziprasidone is indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )].

  "Drug Name: Verapamil Hydrochloride. Description: INDICATIONS AND USAGE Verapamil Hydrochloride Tablets are indicated for the treatment of the following: Angina 1. Angina at rest including: – Vasospastic (Prinzmetal’s variant) angina – Unstable (crescendo, pre-infarction) angina 2. Chronic stable angina (classic effort-associated angina) Arrhythmias 1. In association with digitalis for the control of ventricular rate at rest and during stress in patients with chronic atrial flutter and/or atrial fibrillation (see WARNINGS; Accessory bypass tract ) 2. Prophylaxis of repetitive paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia Essential hypertension: Verapamil is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including this drug. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy..",

While ampicillin and sulbactam for injection is indicated only for the conditions listed above, infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms are also amenable to treatment with ampicillin and sulbactam for injection due to its ampicillin content. Therefore, mixed infections caused by ampicillin-susceptible organisms and beta-lactamase producing organisms susceptible to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should not require the addition of another antibacterial. Appropriate culture and susceptibility tests should be performed before treatment in order to isolate and identify the organisms causing infection and to determine their susceptibility to ampicillin and sulbactam for injection. Therapy may be instituted prior to obtaining the results from bacteriological and susceptibility studies when there is reason to believe the infection may involve any of the beta-lactamase producing organisms listed above in the indicated organ systems. Once the results are known, therapy should be adjusted if appropriate. To reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and maintain effectiveness of ampicillin and sulbactam for injection and other antibacterial drugs, ampicillin and sulbactam for injection should be used only to treat infections that are proven or strongly suspected to be caused by susceptible bacteria.

Description: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, as monotherapy for the acute treatment of bipolar manic or mixed episodes, and as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar disorder. When deciding among the alternative treatments available for the condition needing treatment, the prescriber should consider the finding of ziprasidone’s greater capacity to prolong the QT/QTc interval compared to several other antipsychotic drugs [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ]. Prolongation of the QTc interval is associated in some other drugs with the ability to cause torsade de pointes-type arrhythmia, a potentially fatal polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, and sudden death. In many cases this would lead to the conclusion that other drugs should be tried first. Whether ziprasidone will cause torsade de pointes or increase the rate of sudden death is not yet known [see Warnings and Precautions ( 5.3 ) ] Schizophrenia Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults [see Clinical Studies ( 14.1 ) ]. Bipolar I Disorder (Acute Mixed or Manic Episodes and Maintenance Treatment as an Adjunct to Lithium or Valproate) Ziprasidone capsules are indicated as monotherapy for the acute treatment of adults with manic or mixed episodes associated with bipolar I disorder [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 )]. Ziprasidone capsules are indicated as an adjunct to lithium or valproate for the maintenance treatment of bipolar I disorder in adults [see Clinical Studies ( 14.2 ) ]. Ziprasidone capsule is an atypical antipsychotic. In choosing among treatments, prescribers should be aware of the capacity of ziprasidone capsule to prolong the QT interval and may consider the use of other drugs first (1) Ziprasidone capsules are indicated for the: • treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

  "Drug Name: PACKAGE LABEL.PRINCIPAL DISPLAY PANEL NDC 68258-6969-09 NDC 68258-6969-09. Description: 1. INDICATIONS AND USAGE Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet USP is the combination tablet of valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a diuretic. Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet USP is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure: In patients not adequately controlled with monotherapy ( 1 ) As initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals ( 1 ) Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablet USP is indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including hydrochlorothiazide and the ARB class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise, and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality also have been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure, or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Add-On Therapy Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on monotherapy. Replacement Therapy Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP may be substituted for the titrated components. Initial Therapy Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP may be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals. The choice of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks. Patients with stage 2 hypertension are at a relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks, and heart failure), kidney failure, and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk. Data from the high dose multifactorial trial [see CLINICAL STUDIES ( 14.1 )] provides estimates of the probability of reaching a target blood pressure with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets compared to valsartan or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. The figures below provide estimates of the likelihood of achieving systolic or diastolic blood pressure control with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets USP, 320 mg/25 mg, based upon baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The curve of each treatment group was estimated by logistic regression modeling. The estimated likelihood at the right tail of each curve is less reliable due to small numbers of subjects with high baseline blood pressures. For example, a patient with a baseline blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg has about a 41% likelihood of achieving a goal of <140 mmHg (systolic) and 60% likelihood of achieving <90 mmHg (diastolic) on valsartan alone and the likelihood of achieving these goals on HCTZ alone is about 50% (systolic) or 57% (diastolic). The likelihood of achieving these goals on valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets rises to about 84% (systolic) or 80% (diastolic). The likelihood of achieving these goals on placebo is about 23% (systolic) or 36% (diastolic). image 1.",

  "Drug Name: CAPTOPRIL Label Image. Description: Hypertension Captopril tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension. In using captopril tablets, consideration should be given to the risk of neutropenia/agranulocytosis (see WARNINGS). Captopril tablets may be used as initial therapy for patients with normal renal function, in whom the risk is relatively low. In patients with impaired renal function, particularly those with collagen vascular disease, captopril should be reserved for hypertensives who have either developed unacceptable side effects on other drugs, or have failed to respond satisfactorily to drug combinations. Captopril tablets are effective alone and in combination with other antihypertensive agents, especially thiazide- type diuretics. The blood pressure lowering effects of captopril and thiazides are approximately additive. Heart Failure Captopril tablets are indicated in the treatment of congestive heart failure usually in combination with diuretics and digitalis. The beneficial effect of captopril in heart failure does not require the presence of digitalis, however, most controlled clinical trial experience with captopril has been in patients receiving digitalis, as well as diuretic treatment. Left Ventricular Dysfunction After Myocardial Infarction Captopril tablets are indicated to improve survival following myocardial infarction in clinically stable patients with left ventricular dysfunction manifested as an ejection fraction  40% and to reduce the incidence of overt heart failure and subsequent hospitalizations for congestive heart failure in these patients. Diabetic Nephropathy Captopril tablets are indicated for the treatment of diabetic nephropathy (proteinuria > 500 mg/day) in patients with type I insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus and retinopathy. Captopril tablets decrease the rate of progression of renal insufficiency and development of serious adverse clinical outcomes (death or need for renal transplantation or dialysis). In considering use of captopril tablets, it should be noted that in controlled trials ACE inhibitors have an effect on blood pressure that is less in black patients than in non-blacks. In addition, ACE inhibitors (for which adequate data are available) cause a higher rate of angioedema in black than in non-black patients (see WARNINGS: Head and Neck Angioedema and Intestinal Angioedema)..",

Valsartan and HCTZ 80 mg/12.5 mg Tablets Unit Carton Label Unit Carton. Description: 1 INDICATIONS AND USAGE Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure. Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions. These benefits have been seen in controlled trials of antihypertensive drugs from a wide variety of pharmacologic classes, including hydrochlorothiazide and the ARB class to which valsartan principally belongs. There are no controlled trials demonstrating risk reduction with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets. Control of high blood pressure should be part of comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, including, as appropriate, lipid control, diabetes management, antithrombotic therapy, smoking cessation, exercise and limited sodium intake. Many patients will require more than one drug to achieve blood pressure goals. For specific advice on goals and management, see published guidelines, such as those of the National High Blood Pressure Education Program’s Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC). Numerous antihypertensive drugs, from a variety of pharmacologic classes and with different mechanisms of action, have been shown in randomized controlled trials to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, and it can be concluded that it is blood pressure reduction, and not some other pharmacologic property of the drugs, that is largely responsible for those benefits. The largest and most consistent cardiovascular outcome benefit has been a reduction in the risk of stroke, but reductions in myocardial infarction and cardiovascular mortality have also been seen regularly. Elevated systolic or diastolic pressure causes increased cardiovascular risk, and the absolute risk increase per mmHg is greater at higher blood pressures, so that even modest reductions of severe hypertension can provide substantial benefit. Relative risk reduction from blood pressure reduction is similar across populations with varying absolute risk, so the absolute benefit is greater in patients who are at higher risk independent of their hypertension (for example, patients with diabetes or hyperlipidemia), and such patients would be expected to benefit from more aggressive treatment to a lower blood pressure goal. Some antihypertensive drugs have smaller blood pressure effects (as monotherapy) in black patients, and many antihypertensive drugs have additional approved indications and effects (e.g., on angina, heart failure or diabetic kidney disease). These considerations may guide selection of therapy. Add-On Therapy: Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used in patients whose blood pressure is not adequately controlled on monotherapy. Replacement Therapy: Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be substituted for the titrated components. Initial Therapy: Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets may be used as initial therapy in patients who are likely to need multiple drugs to achieve blood pressure goals. The choice of valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets as initial therapy for hypertension should be based on an assessment of potential benefits and risks. Patients with stage 2 hypertension are at a relatively high risk for cardiovascular events (such as strokes, heart attacks and heart failure), kidney failure and vision problems, so prompt treatment is clinically relevant. The decision to use a combination as initial therapy should be individualized and should be shaped by considerations such as baseline blood pressure, the target goal and the incremental likelihood of achieving goal with a combination compared to monotherapy. Individual blood pressure goals may vary based upon the patient’s risk. Data from the high dose multifactorial trial [see Clinical Studies (14.1) ] provides estimates of the probability of reaching a target blood pressure with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets compared to valsartan or hydrochlorothiazide monotherapy. The figures below provide estimates of the likelihood of achieving systolic or diastolic blood pressure control with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets 320 mg/25 mg, based upon baseline systolic or diastolic blood pressure. The curve of each treatment group was estimated by logistic regression modeling. The estimated likelihood at the right tail of each curve is less reliable due to small numbers of subjects with high baseline blood pressures. For example, a patient with a baseline blood pressure of 160/100 mmHg has about a 41% likelihood of achieving a goal of < 140 mmHg (systolic) and 60% likelihood of achieving < 90 mmHg (diastolic) on valsartan alone and the likelihood of achieving these goals on HCTZ alone is about 50% (systolic) or 57% (diastolic). The likelihood of achieving these goals on valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets rises to about 84% (systolic) or 80% (diastolic). The likelihood of achieving these goals on placebo is about 23% (systolic) or 36% (diastolic). Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide is the combination tablet of valsartan, an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) and hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a diuretic. Valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide tablets are indicated for the treatment of hypertension, to lower blood pressure: In patients not adequately controlled with monotherapy ( 1 ) As initial therapy in patients likely to need multiple drugs to achieve their blood pressure goals ( 1 ) Lowering blood pressure reduces the risk of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events, primarily strokes and myocardial infarctions.

  "Disease: bupropion; Amfebutamone; 34911-55-2; 2-(tert-butylamino)-1-(3-chlorophenyl)propan-1-one; Amfebutamon; .... Description: Bupropion is an aromatic ketone that is propiophenone carrying a tert-butylamino group at position 2 and a chloro substituent at position 3 on the phenyl ring. It has a role as an antidepressant, an environmental contaminant and a xenobiotic. It is a secondary amino compound, a member of monochlorobenzenes and an aromatic ketone. ChEBI Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin®) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT). Bupropion was originally classified as an \"atypical\" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs, bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors. Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example. When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor. A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT). Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response. Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD. When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways. Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure. The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo. DrugBank Bupropion is an Aminoketone. The mechanism of action of bupropion is as a Dopamine Uptake Inhibitor, and Norepinephrine Uptake Inhibitor. The physiologic effect of bupropion is by means of Increased Dopamine Activity, and Increased Norepinephrine Activity. FDA Pharm Classes View More....",
